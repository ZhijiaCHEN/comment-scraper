                                                        Suites in Terre Haute, Indiana, at 9 p.m. The hotel sits at the
                                                        intersection of U.S. Highway 41 and Interstate 70. The
                                                        interstate leads all the way to Baltimore, where Wingate’s
                                                        brother, Dustin Higgs, had been sentenced to die more than 20
                                                        years earlier.</p>

                                                        the banks of the Wabash River, is the federal death chamber.
                                                        Montgomery, the only woman under a federal death sentence, was
                                                        being held in a small room adjacent to it. The execution chamber
                                                        was constructed just after the passage of the 1994 crime bill,
                                                        but the surrounding penitentiary predates even the interstate.
                                                        When the prison first opened more than 75 years ago, the meeting

                                                        “Crossroads of America” — a convenient location to bring people
                                                        in federal custody from all over the country.</p>
                                                    <p>Higgs arrived on federal death row in January 2001, just five
                                                        months before the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
                                                        McVeigh. After the Trump administration restarted executions
                                                        last summer following a 17-year pause, Higgs saw 10 of his
                                                        neighbors taken to their deaths. On November 20, the day after

                                                        Higgs got an execution date himself. On Friday, after the

                                                        to be the last person to die in Trump’s killing spree. Wingate

                                                    <p>“Dustin is actually technically my first cousin,” Wingate
                                                        explained when we first spoke in December. But they grew up
                                                        largely in the same household in Poughkeepsie, New York, and
                                                        refer to each other as brother and sister. “When Dustin first
                                                        came home from the hospital, I was there,” Wingate said.</p>
                                                    <p>After giving birth to her own daughter in 1990, Wingate enlisted
                                                        in the Army, the best of a limited set of options. “I had to
                                                        find a way to take care of her, to get a skill, and my family
                                                        didn’t have money for me to go to college.” Following a year
                                                        stationed in South Korea, she moved to Washington, D.C. — and
                                                        Higgs followed. By then, Wingate was raising two kids while
                                                        going to night school at the University of the District of

                                                        wanted to open a barbershop and Wingate wanted to be a funeral
                                                        director. “I said, ‘OK, well, you can come and we can start this
                                                        family business. You can fix the hair. I’ll do the makeup and
                                                        I’ll do the embalming and all that,’” Wingate said. “That was
                                                        our original goal.” But eventually Higgs started to pull away
                                                        from her.</p>
                                                    <p>Wingate had moved back to New York when she got a phone call in
                                                        1996 saying that Higgs had been arrested for dealing drugs. “I
                                                        was like, ‘How did you keep that from me?’ He said because he
                                                        knew I wouldn’t approve, so he never brought it around me at
                                                        all.” But a worse nightmare unfolded in 1998, when Higgs was
                                                        charged as a suspect in a horrific triple murder. The victims,

                                                    <p>Investigators found a day planner in Jackson’s purse that
                                                        contained Higgs’s address and license plate number. After Higgs
                                                        initially denied any involvement to police, a pair of his
                                                        associates, Victor Gloria and Willis Haynes, were arrested
                                                        together on federal drug charges, prompting what an investigator
                                                        would later describe as an “incredible confession” from Gloria.
                                                        Agreeing to be a witness for the government in exchange for a
                                                        lesser sentence, Gloria testified that the three men had been
                                                        hanging out with Chinn, Jackson, and Black in Higgs’s apartment
                                                        when Jackson rejected Higgs. The two argued and she took down
                                                        his information. Higgs became angry, telling Gloria and Haynes
                                                        that Jackson “knew some people” who could hurt him. After
                                                        offering the women a ride back toward D.C., according to Gloria,
                                                        Higgs instead drove the group in his van to the federal reserve,
                                                        where he gave Haynes a handgun and said, “Make sure they’re all
                                                        dead.”</p>
                                                    <p>Wingate was skeptical from the start. She had never known Higgs
                                                        to be violent toward women. When Higgs called her after the
                                                        charges were filed, “I remember him saying, ‘You know I didn’t.’
                                                        And I said, ‘You don’t even have to finish that sentence. I know
                                                        you didn’t.’”</p>
                                                    <p>And there were reasons to doubt Gloria’s credibility. In his
                                                        earliest statements to police, he said that he’d been passed out
                                                        in the backseat of Higgs’s van and woke up to gunshots. But
                                                        later, he said he saw 23-year-old Higgs give 18-year-old Haynes
                                                        the gun and threaten him if he did not shoot the women. At
                                                        Haynes’s trial in August 2000, which ended in a life sentence,
                                                        the government argued that he had not been intimidated by Higgs
                                                        into shooting the women. Shortly afterward, at Higgs’s trial,
                                                        the same prosecutors cast Higgs as the dominant player who had
                                                        coerced Haynes into doing his bidding. On October 11, 2000,
                                                        jurors convicted Higgs.</p>
                                                    <p>Later that month, Wingate drove down to Baltimore with the aunt
                                                        who had raised them both as kids. “His lawyers asked us to
                                                        testify at his sentencing hearing, to make them know what we
                                                        know about Dustin, that he’s not this monster that the
                                                        prosecution said he is,” she recalled. There was plenty to say.
                                                        Higgs’s mother had died of cancer when he was a child, and the
                                                        whole family saw how, in the absence of his father, he strived
                                                        to take care of her in her final days. But Wingate felt
                                                        unprepared. It was the first time she had seen Higgs in person
                                                        in four years. “I’m trying to answer the questions that they’re
                                                        asking me,” she said, but “I’m just crying.”</p>

                                                        time for her shift. Wingate was home crocheting a blanket for
                                                        Higgs when one of her cousins called. “She said, ‘Hey, Lex, you

                                                        but not a surprise. Many had high hopes that <a

                                                        calls for clemency ignored by the president. After 11 executions

                                                        based in part on the fact that he was convicted in Maryland,

                                                        on cruel and unusual punishment. Johnson’s family was ecstatic
                                                        over the news, according to his spiritual adviser, who had to

                                                        argues that not only did Willis Haynes pull the trigger that

                                                        such a thing to begin with.</p>
                                                    <p>His claims are backed up by an affidavit written by Haynes in
                                                        2012, which was included in a clemency application for Higgs
                                                        during the Obama administration. “The prosecution’s theory of
                                                        our case was bullshit,” Haynes wrote. “Dustin didn’t threaten
                                                        me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn’t make me do anything
                                                        that night or ever.” Higgs also argues that his defense
                                                        attorneys failed to investigate critical witnesses — and that
                                                        federal prosecutors hid evidence from his attorneys at trial.

                                                    <p>Especially consequential was evidence that the government’s star
                                                        witness, Gloria, was a suspect in a separate murder case in
                                                        Baltimore, but the FBI did not pursue him in order to gain his
                                                        help in the case against Higgs. In a 2014 affidavit, Higgs’s
                                                        trial attorney Henry Trainor wrote that the information about
                                                        Gloria would have altered the case significantly. “I consider
                                                        receiving a free pass on a murder charge to be an extraordinary
                                                        benefit for a witness,” he said. Had defense attorneys been
                                                        aware of this deal, he added, they certainly would have used it
                                                        to challenge Gloria’s credibility.</p>
                                                    <p>It is not uncommon to see evidence like this revealed after a
                                                        person has been sentenced to death. Yet such red flags are often
                                                        not enough to stop an execution. Even if Higgs did not direct
                                                        Haynes to shoot Chinn, Jackson, and Black, he still would have
                                                        been eligible for the death penalty under a felony murder
                                                        prosecution. In some ways, his case is emblematic of the death
                                                        penalty as a punishment reserved not for the “worst of the

                                                    <p>The killing of Chinn, Jackson, and Black came at a time when the
                                                        Department of Justice had been preparing to ramp up executions.
                                                        Less than a year before the murders, in July 1995, the Baltimore
                                                        Sun reported that federal prosecutors were on the lookout for
                                                        cases that might warrant the death penalty. “It could be a gang
                                                        lord or a murderous carjacker or a drug smuggler,” the Sun
                                                        reported. “But sometime in the coming months, U.S. Attorney
                                                        Lynne A. Battaglia expects to take the unprecedented step of
                                                        seeking the death penalty against someone for committing a
                                                        federal crime in Maryland.”</p>
                                                    <p>The Sun cited a number of downsides. For one, each federal death
                                                        penalty case was estimated to cost $340,000 “in public defender
                                                        fees alone.” What’s more, contrary to popular assumption, police
                                                        seemed skeptical of the need for executions to maintain law and
                                                        order. “In a recent poll of the nation’s police chiefs, the
                                                        death penalty ranked last among methods they felt were effective
                                                        in reducing street crime.”</p>
                                                    <p>Finally, there was the age-old problem of racism. A 1994

                                                        which federal prosecutors chose to seek the death penalty under
                                                        the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act involved Black or Latino
                                                        defendants. Nevertheless, Battaglia told the Sun that the public
                                                        was demanding death penalty prosecutions. “I hope we never have
                                                        to consider it,” she said. “But there are circumstances where
                                                        you have to take people out of society.”</p>
                                                    <p>Veteran private investigator Sharon Weidenfeld had been working
                                                        on murder cases in Prince George’s County for years when she was
                                                        hired to work on Higgs’s defense. Although her recollections are
                                                        sketchy, she remembered conducting a key interview with Gloria’s
                                                        ex-girlfriend, Katrina Havenner, in September 2000. Havenner
                                                        told Weidenfeld that despite Gloria’s new statements to police,
                                                        he told her that he’d been asleep when Haynes shot the three
                                                        women. She repeated the statement in a 2006 affidavit,
                                                        explaining that Gloria could never hold his liquor and would
                                                        pass out after drinking. According to Havenner, Gloria also told
                                                        her that Haynes had threatened to kill her and their daughter if
                                                        he said anything. “Victor believed Willis and so did I,” she
                                                        said.</p>
                                                    <p>Havenner’s claims were corroborated by Gloria himself in a 2004
                                                        interview conducted by an investigator working with Higgs’s
                                                        legal team at the Federal Community Defender Office for the
                                                        Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Gloria complained that he’d
                                                        been incarcerated “for nothing,” since he was asleep when the
                                                        women were shot, the investigator wrote in an affidavit. “When I
                                                        then asked Mr. Gloria whether that meant that his statements and
                                                        testimony concerning the events that occurred at the crime scene
                                                        were not true,” the investigator continued, “Mr. Gloria replied,

                                                        death row. The officer, Stephanie Mohr, had a history of using

                                                    <h3>A Prayer for Six Days</h3>
                                                    <p>Early Wednesday morning, Wingate went to see Higgs with her son
                                                        JaCobi. They had to report to the penitentiary by 7:30 a.m. She
                                                        had not slept much the night before. It was the first time she
                                                        was going to see her brother since his sentencing trial, and she
                                                        was anxious and excited.</p>
                                                    <p>In their phone calls, Wingate said, Higgs has told her what it is
                                                        like on the day after an execution. “He’s like, ‘It’s quiet.
                                                        It’s so quiet.’ Because usually people are watching TV … or
                                                        they’re talking to each other through the cell.” But after an
                                                        execution, “nobody’s talking.”</p>
                                                    <p>In his emails to me over the past month and a half, Higgs
                                                        emphasized his innocence and decried the corrupt system that
                                                        sent him to death row. He shared his dismay over the execution
                                                        of Bernard, who was a close friend. On the day after Christmas,
                                                        he offered condolences for the bombing in Nashville, where I
                                                        live.</p>
                                                    <p>More recently, he has described what he wants his legacy to be.
                                                        For the past 20 years, he has tried “to re-educate myself by
                                                        reading hundred upon hundreds of books,” he said, and more
                                                        recently he taught himself to paint. “I have also wrote a
                                                        children book, and a book comprised of my reflective thoughts.”
                                                        The goal, he said, is to make a difference, to honor his family,
                                                        and to “bring them out of poverty.”</p>
                                                    <p>He also worries about how his execution will impact Wingate if it
                                                        goes through. She has been his protector since he was little, he
                                                        said. “When the boys my age would beat me up, my sister would
                                                        leap into action and protect her little brother,” he said. “That
                                                        is one of many reasons that our bond is so strong today. I am 48
                                                        years old and my sister is still fighting on my behalf.”</p>
                                                    <p>The families of Chinn, Jackson, and Black did not respond to
                                                        emails sent this week. It is not clear whether they plan to
                                                        witness Higgs’s execution. “My heart goes out to them,” Wingate
                                                        said. “I haven’t lost a child. I don’t know what that’s like. …
                                                        I just want them to understand that it’s not my brother that did
                                                        it.”</p>
                                                    <p>With the Justice Department appealing Chutkan’s ruling, Wingate
                                                        is trying to focus on making the most of her time with Higgs.
                                                        She will spend Thursday visiting her brother, possibly for the
                                                        last time. She admitted to feeling some hope after he tested
                                                        positive in December. It sounds terrible to say, “I’m glad you
                                                        got Covid,” she said, “but that’s not what it is. &#8230; It’s
                                                        just a feeling of maybe this can slow down your execution.” With
                                                        the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, even a short delay
                                                        would change everything.</p>
                                                    <p>“Just give me six days,” Wingate said. “Every night I go to bed
                                                        and that’s all I pray for. … I don’t care if it’s a stay or a
                                                        reprieve, whatever. Six days is all I pray for. Six days.”</p>

After the Trump administration restarted executions last summer following a 17-year pause, Higgs saw 10 of his neighbors taken to their deaths. On November 20, the day after his friend \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/11/18/death-penalty-execution-orlando-hall/\" target=\"_blank\">Orlando Hall\u003c/a> died by lethal injection, Higgs got an execution date himself.

Higgs wanted to open a barbershop and Wingate wanted to be a funeral director. “I said, ‘OK, well, you can come and we can start this family business. You can fix the hair. I’ll do the makeup and I’ll do the embalming and all that,’” Wingate said. “That was our original goal.” But eventually Higgs started to pull away from her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wingate had moved back to New York when she got a phone call in 1996 saying that Higgs had been arrested for dealing drugs. “I was like, ‘How did you keep that from me?’ He said because he knew I wouldn’t approve, so he never brought it around me at all.” But a worse nightmare unfolded in 1998, when Higgs was charged as a suspect in a horrific triple murder. The victims, Mishann Chinn, 23, Tanji Jackson, 21, and Tamika Black, 19, had been found fatally shot around 4 a.m. on January 27, 1996, on a road that cut through the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, a federal tract of land in Prince George’s County, between D.C. and Baltimore. All three worked in local schools and did not fit investigators’ profile of women whose lives might “invite violence,” according to a true crime \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-leave-you-our-deaths/id1532894981?i=1000504489472\" target=\"_blank\">podcast\u003c/a> that recently explored the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\>\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[2] --\>“I remember him saying, ‘You know I didn’t.’ And I said, ‘You don’t even have to finish that sentence.

After Higgs initially denied any involvement to police, a pair of his associates, Victor Gloria and Willis Haynes, were arrested together on federal drug charges, prompting what an investigator would later describe as an “incredible confession” from Gloria. Agreeing to be a witness for the government in exchange for a lesser sentence, Gloria testified that the three men had been hanging out with Chinn, Jackson, and Black in Higgs’s apartment when Jackson rejected Higgs. The two argued and she took down his information. Higgs became angry, telling Gloria and Haynes that Jackson “knew some people” who could hurt him. After offering the women a ride back toward D.C., according to Gloria, Higgs instead drove the group in his van to the federal reserve, where he gave Haynes a handgun and said, “Make sure they’re all dead.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wingate was skeptical from the start. She had never known Higgs to be violent toward women. When Higgs called her after the charges were filed, “I remember him saying, ‘You know I didn’t.’ And I said, ‘You don’t even have to finish that sentence. I know you didn’t.’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there were reasons to doubt Gloria’s credibility. In his earliest statements to police, he said that he’d been passed out in the backseat of Higgs’s van and woke up to gunshots. But later, he said he saw 23-year-old Higgs give 18-year-old Haynes the gun and threaten him if he did not shoot the women. At Haynes’s trial in August 2000, which ended in a life sentence, the government argued that he had not been intimidated by Higgs into shooting the women. Shortly afterward, at Higgs’s trial, the same prosecutors cast Higgs as the dominant player who had coerced Haynes into doing his bidding. On October 11, 2000, jurors convicted Higgs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later that month, Wingate drove down to Baltimore with the aunt who had raised them both as kids. “His lawyers asked us to testify at his sentencing hearing, to make them know what we know about Dustin, that he’s not this monster that the prosecution said he is,” she recalled. There was plenty to say. Higgs’s mother had died of cancer when he was a child, and the whole family saw how, in the absence of his father, he strived to take care of her in her final days. But Wingate felt unprepared. It was the first time she had seen Higgs in person in four years. “I’m trying to answer the questions that they’re asking me,” she said, but “I’m just crying.”\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"4\">\u003c/div>\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3] --\>\n\u003cp>Federal prosecutors urged jurors to sentence Higgs to death. “The hard truth is, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a better world in the future without Dustin Higgs,” one \u003ca href=\"https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/353/353.F3d.281.01-3.html\" target=\"_blank\">told\u003c/a> the jury.

Many had high hopes that \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/12/05/federal-executions-brandon-bernard/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon Bernard\u003c/a> would be saved in December, only to see his appeals dismissed by the courts and calls for clemency ignored by the president. After 11 executions waved through by the U.S. Supreme Court, few are optimistic that Johnson or Higgs will be spared.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet, like Montgomery, both men have legal claims that have never been fully adjudicated. Johnson has an intellectual disability that \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/opinion/death-penalty-mental-disability.html\" target=\"_blank\">should\u003c/a> make him ineligible for execution — and Higgs has \u003ca href=\"https://www.fd.org/news/dustin-higgs-execution-roadblock-govt-appeal-be-heard-twelve-days-after-scheduled-execution\" target=\"_blank\">convinced\u003c/a> a federal court to schedule an oral argument on whether his execution would violate federal law based in part on the fact that he was convicted in Maryland, which abolished the death penalty in 2013. That argument is set for January 27 — 12 days after Higgs is supposed to die. But such things have not stood in the way of the federal executions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like more than half of the men on federal death row, both Johnson and Higgs contracted Covid-19 last month. Attorneys \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/men-death-row-covid-19-increase-suffering-execution_n_5ff5cbc4c5b6ea7351c70339\" target=\"_blank\">argued\u003c/a> that lung damage from the illness would make them vulnerable to an especially tortuous death by lethal injection, which has been shown to cause pulmonary edema.

Johnson’s family was ecstatic over the news, according to his spiritual adviser, who had to explain to them that this would not necessarily stop the execution. Wingate was hopeful too. But in a phone call after she landed in Indiana, her brother warned her not to assume the ruling would hold.\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\">\u003c/div>\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] --\>\n\u003cp>To Higgs, the issues raised in the current litigation pale in comparison to what he has insisted upon for years: that he is innocent of the crime that sent him to death row. On a \u003ca href=\"http://www.savedustinjhiggs.com\" target=\"_blank\">website\u003c/a> created by his advocates, Higgs argues that not only did Willis Haynes pull the trigger that killed Chinn, Jackson, and Black, but Higgs also never ordered such a thing to begin with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>His claims are backed up by an affidavit written by Haynes in 2012, which was included in a clemency application for Higgs during the Obama administration. “The prosecution’s theory of our case was bullshit,” Haynes wrote. “Dustin didn’t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn’t make me do anything that night or ever.” Higgs also argues that his defense attorneys failed to investigate critical witnesses — and that federal prosecutors hid evidence from his attorneys at trial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Especially consequential was evidence that the government’s star witness, Gloria, was a suspect in a separate murder case in Baltimore, but the FBI did not pursue him in order to gain his help in the case against Higgs. In a 2014 affidavit, Higgs’s trial attorney Henry Trainor wrote that the information about Gloria would have altered the case significantly. “I consider receiving a free pass on a murder charge to be an extraordinary benefit for a witness,” he said. Had defense attorneys been aware of this deal, he added, they certainly would have used it to challenge Gloria’s credibility.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It is not uncommon to see evidence like this revealed after a person has been sentenced to death. Yet such red flags are often not enough to stop an execution. Even if Higgs did not direct Haynes to shoot Chinn, Jackson, and Black, he still would have been eligible for the death penalty under a felony murder prosecution. In some ways, his case is emblematic of the death penalty as a punishment reserved not for the “worst of the worst,” but for those who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time — in this case, facing federal murder charges in the District of Maryland in the wake of the 1994 crime bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22large%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\" style=\"width: auto;\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[6] --\>\n\u003cp>\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-340984\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2021/01/6E3A9704-1000x667.jpg\" alt=\"6E3A9704\" />\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">Charles Keith, left, brother of former Ohio death row prisoner Kevin Keith, and Roderick Reed, right, brother of Texas death row prisoner Rodney Reed, attend a rally against federal executions in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 9, 2021.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption source pullright\">\nPhoto: Scott Langley \u003c/p>\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[6] --\>\u003c/div>\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[6] --\>\n\u003cp>The killing of Chinn, Jackson, and Black came at a time when the Department of Justice had been preparing to ramp up executions. Less than a year before the murders, in July 1995, the Baltimore Sun reported that federal prosecutors were on the lookout for cases that might warrant the death penalty. “It could be a gang lord or a murderous carjacker or a drug smuggler,” the Sun reported. “But sometime in the coming months, U.S. Attorney Lynne A. Battaglia expects to take the unprecedented step of seeking the death penalty against someone for committing a federal crime in Maryland.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Sun cited a number of downsides. For one, each federal death penalty case was estimated to cost $340,000 “in public defender fees alone.” What’s more, contrary to popular assumption, police seemed skeptical of the need for executions to maintain law and order. “In a recent poll of the nation’s police chiefs, the death penalty ranked last among methods they felt were effective in reducing street crime.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, there was the age-old problem of racism. A 1994 congressional study \u003ca href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/in-depth/racial-disparities-in-federal-death-penalty-prosecutions-1988-1994\" target=\"_blank\">found\u003c/a> that 89 percent of the cases in which federal prosecutors chose to seek the death penalty under the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act involved Black or Latino defendants. Nevertheless, Battaglia told the Sun that the public was demanding death penalty prosecutions. “I hope we never have to consider it,” she said. “But there are circumstances where you have to take people out of society.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Veteran private investigator Sharon Weidenfeld had been working on murder cases in Prince George’s County for years when she was hired to work on Higgs’s defense. Although her recollections are sketchy, she remembered conducting a key interview with Gloria’s ex-girlfriend, Katrina Havenner, in September 2000. Havenner told Weidenfeld that despite Gloria’s new statements to police, he told her that he’d been asleep when Haynes shot the three women. She repeated the statement in a 2006 affidavit, explaining that Gloria could never hold his liquor and would pass out after drinking. According to Havenner, Gloria also told her that Haynes had threatened to kill her and their daughter if he said anything. “Victor believed Willis and so did I,” she said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Havenner’s claims were corroborated by Gloria himself in a 2004 interview conducted by an investigator working with Higgs’s legal team at the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Gloria complained that he’d been incarcerated “for nothing,” since he was asleep when the women were shot, the investigator wrote in an affidavit. “When I then asked Mr. Gloria whether that meant that his statements and testimony concerning the events that occurred at the crime scene were not true,” the investigator continued, “Mr. Gloria replied, ‘That was the police.’”\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22none%22%7D) --\>\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-none\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[7] --\>“People will give statements to the police and tell them one thing and then when I interview them, they’ll tell me something else.

On the day after Christmas, he offered condolences for the bombing in Nashville, where I live.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>More recently, he has described what he wants his legacy to be. For the past 20 years, he has tried “to re-educate myself by reading hundred upon hundreds of books,” he said, and more recently he taught himself to paint. “I have also wrote a children book, and a book comprised of my reflective thoughts.” The goal, he said, is to make a difference, to honor his family, and to “bring them out of poverty.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He also worries about how his execution will impact Wingate if it goes through. She has been his protector since he was little, he said. “When the boys my age would beat me up, my sister would leap into action and protect her little brother,” he said. “That is one of many reasons that our bond is so strong today. I am 48 years old and my sister is still fighting on my behalf.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The families of Chinn, Jackson, and Black did not respond to emails sent this week. It is not clear whether they plan to witness Higgs’s execution. “My heart goes out to them,” Wingate said. “I haven’t lost a child. I don’t know what that’s like. … I just want them to understand that it’s not my brother that did it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With the Justice Department appealing Chutkan’s ruling, Wingate is trying to focus on making the most of her time with Higgs. She will spend Thursday visiting her brother, possibly for the last time. She admitted to feeling some hope after he tested positive in December. It sounds terrible to say, “I’m glad you got Covid,” she said, “but that’s not what it is. &#8230; It’s just a feeling of maybe this can slow down your execution.” With the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, even a short delay would change everything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Just give me six days,” Wingate said. “Every night I go to bed and that’s all I pray for. … I don’t care if it’s a stay or a reprieve, whatever. Six days is all I pray for. Six days.”\u003c/p>\n", "credit_additional_reporting": "", "credit_additional_reporting_users_object": "", "credit_photo_illustration": "", "credit_research": "", "credit_research_users_object": "", "credit_translation": "", "credit_translation_users_object": "", "custom_classname": "", "date": "2021-01-14T11:00:39+00:00", "date_local": "2021-01-14T06:00:39+00:00", "documents": "", "excerpt": "Higgs was sentenced to death for his role in a triple murder.
