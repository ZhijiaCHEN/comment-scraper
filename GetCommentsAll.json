It was pretty clear back in 2016 that the guy is a cheat and a fraud, and the subsequent 4 years only made that more clear.\n\nWhat I find most stunning is that our tax system allows this. For example, why do we let companies claim a refund on taxes paid in prior years? This makes no sense to me. There should also be a shorter cap on the number of years a company is allowed to carry losses forward. This degree of freedom just encourages companies with the means to game the system. \n\nI switched to the public sector a few years ago and I specifically remember the ethics training during onboarding. We basically had to declare all potential conflicts of interest to the department so that we could be cleared to do the work we were hired to perform. Not doing so could result in our termination. This is for a city government job mind you. Why isn’t there a law that holds the POTUS to this same basic standard as a lowly city employee?\n\nAs a democratic nation, we have a lot of self-reflecting to do. It’s easy to sit at our desk crying foul, but we must then ask ourselves what we plan to do about it.",

Maximizing deductions for depreciation under the substantially expanded rules in TCJA '17 is avoidance. Deducting a private jet, unless he pays his company the going rate for private use of a jumbo jet, is tax evasion. \n\nWhat I saw in this article exceeded that fine line. Excessive deductions and misuse of mixed-use assets. Above-market consulting fees to related party businesses for little or no work. An intent not just to lower effective tax rate, but to transfer money to relatives  to elude gift and estate tax. Likely inflated values of partnerships in order to deduct the initial investment lost under \"walkaway rules\" - and then failure to include any recoupment of losses in later tax years. \n\nI hope this makes people angry. This is why I research and study tax law \u0026 policy, and don't file returns for the wealthy. While all of this was going on, Trump was also significantly reducing funds for IRS enforcement and audits for high-net worth individuals... while expanding audits for the poorest of the poor who receive earned-income tax credits (EITC).",

That Trump has massive debts to foreign nations that would compromise his ability to properly represent this nation. And now the facts are here for all to see.\n\nAnd yet.... There are still 42% of our citizens who won't believe any of this. Trump's accountant could provide these voters with notarized copies and they still wouldn't believe it. They will continue to simply parrot his \"fake news\" mantra.\n\nAfter this revelation, there is no doubt that Trump voters are nothing more than a cult. And with our system of government that permits the minority to elect a president, we could well see this grossly unfit man elected to a second term.\n\nThere have been so many revelations about Trump - based on his own conduct and actions - that would have been the nail in the coffin for any other president - and yet his voters are still in lockstep with him.\n\nJust further evidence that we are no longer in the America we knew before 2016.
