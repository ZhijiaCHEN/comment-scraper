But Mr. Douthat hits the nail on the head when he says, \"an ideological revolution in elite spaces in American culture, in which concepts heretofore associated with academic progressivism have permeated the language of many important institutions\".  This newspaper itself sponsored the 1619 project whose initial thesis was that the American Revolution was fought to preserve the institution of slavery.  Last night's election results are in part a repudiation of this kind of thinking, a thinking that largely emanates from the Progressive wing of the Democratic party and forms the ideological foundation of their policy initiatives.",

However, politics are local and in local races we should be prepared to lose if things don’t change.\n\nBut let’s not kid ourselves Democrats aren’t shining examples either. I’m sure every moderate will have an issue where the party overreached or is inconsistent. For me it’s the consistent message that Asians need to shut up and accept quotas, institutional racism, and limits (affirmative action, or worse what DeBlasio suggested). \n\nI can only hope that the party wakes up.

However, it seems that the problem as it affects the VA election is that a lot white people take the mention of racism as a personal affront. Hannah Jones' take on the American revolution has more factual basis than do claims that Loudon Country school  children are being indoctrinated with CRT in school.",

And, maybe beyond repair for a generation or two.  No result will ever be considered valid unless your side wins.\n\nAs far as the actual result in Virginia, two centuries of experience both good and bad demonstrate that American has been premised on a centering balance- nothing unusual about that - it is how group dynamics no matter the size works.  Hard fact that liberals need to understand, and sadly, a lesson that the right wing will not learn until we dance a bit more with authoritarianism.",

So if he could have picked up roughly 7% of these potential supporters (i.e., Democrats, Independents and Republican crossovers who stayed home this time around), he would have won.\n\nDemocrats should consider what just happened in Virginia as a dry run for the midterms next year.  *They need to up Democratic voter turnout - in some regions by as much as 10% or more.*  This may seem a daunting task, but it is doable - albeit with a great deal of effort.\n\nDemocrats have the next year to get that done.\n\nThe clock is ticking.",

He can't afford to alienate any Democratic coalitions because Democrats are like herding cats - they clearly are not a monolithic unit.\n\nBesides, progressive ideologies are built into BBB - after all, Bernie had a big part in writing it - and that's Biden's signature agenda, whether or not it ever actually passes.\n\nAgain, I would take everything equal in a year - BBB, Afghanistan, the pandemic, voting and abortion rights, the Supreme Court, the filibuster and Trump with Jan. 6 and NYS tax charges.  I am assuming (for simplicity) that things will more or less cancel out, and we'll find ourselves in roughly the same place overall in another year.\n\nFor Democrats to win the midterms, they need the votes.  And they must win the midterms, or there will be congressional gridlock into 2024, and that will likely cost Democrats the presidency the next time around.  And that will put the country back in perilous shape with the possible return of a Trump presidency - perhaps coupled with a Congress controlled by the GOP.\n\nThat very well would be the end of us.",

Biden is the figurehead of the Democratic Party: he should be repeating this over and over again from here to eternity.  Meanwhile, he needs to keep things like CRT and \"defund the police\" in proper perspective - that is, in check.  Still, the political cycle is working against Democrats next year - usually the party in power loses seats in Congress in the midterms.  *So Democratic politicians need to cater specifically to Democratic voters who haven't been voting.*  These voters will be receptive to Biden's core messages.  And they are least likely to be put off by issues such as CRT, \"defund the police,\" and BLM.  Democrats could gain more power in Congress after the midterms by garnering perhaps as little as 2-3% more votes from Democratic supporters who have not been voting recently.  *Then Democrats can work to fully enact their agenda.*  That's sure to help them in 2024 - and beyond.  That's the way for Democrats to go.  It's a straightforward plan - it can work.  And it can wind up saving American democracy, too.",

The poll was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, The Washington Post and other media organizations. See the bottom of the page for exit poll methodology.\n\nEconomy and jobs were top issues for Virginia voters\n\nAbout one-third of Virginia voters said that the economy was the most important issue facing Virginia, according to preliminary network exit polling. That was followed by about one-quarter naming education as the most important issue in their vote. Fewer than 2 in 10 said taxes or the coronavirus were their top issues, and about 1 in 10 said abortion.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor</a>/\n\nAs Clinton observed :  It is the economy, st..d.

I will never understand the mindset of the republican voter who continually votes for the party that is obstructing any progress. We denigrate Manchin and Sinema as the ones at fault when not a single republican will ever vote for legislation that will help their constituents. I would imagine that Florida, the state with the highest elderly population, would benefit from lower prescription drug prices yet no-one, including the press, is holding Rubio's and Scott's feet to the fire or gaetz's and their other congressmen who will not vote for a win for the people they represent. Yet they keep getting elected, time and again. I just don't get it. They kick their voters in the teeth and the voters keep going back for more. \n\nWe need to get rid of political teams. These congress people and other elected officials work for us. They are there to serve us, their employer. We hear ad nauseam how workers need to be \"team\" players but don't expect our elected officials to be Team USA players.\n\nI'm so tired of this constant worry and stress. I hope the movement to dissolve the USA strengthens. The USA  is a dismal failure. Time to end the experiment and let those of us who want a government that serves the people get our choice.

The good news is that everybody else knows it, the bad news is that the Dems either don't or won't want to hear it.

What the Virginia election shows is that no matter who Democrats run they are going to be portrayed as radical leftists by Republicans.\n\nThe Democrats could try to purge all progressives and progressive ideas from their party to appear more like Republican moderates. I'm not sure that makes them stronger, though. White people won't necessarily choose the Democratic version of a Republican over the Republican version of a Republican. The best the Democrats could hope for from such a strategy is a 50% chance of winning. More likely, it means the Democrats lose a lot of their more progressive base while fighting to win moderate white voters who lean Republican and are still more likely to vote Republican than Democrat. And even if progressives are banished from the Democratic Party, Republicans are still going to fight the same culture wars and still brand Democrats as radicals.\n\nThe alternative for Democrats is to embrace the big transformative programs—universal childcare, universal health care, etc.—that start out as popular until a combination of Republicans and centrist Democrats start branding them as too radical. The Democrats are suffering greatly from Manchin and Sinema joining Republicans in branding Democratic policy as extreme and fiscally irresponsible. If the Democrats need to purge anyone from their party, it's Democrats who reinforce GOP talking points and stop the Democrats from running on anything big.",

Younkin being an unknown was more susceptible to having himself mischaracterized.\n\nThat is the false characterization that happened and it didn't work. Both McAuliffe and Younkin are moderates and only McAuliffe made repeated attempts to characterize his opponent with the worst aspects of his party.",

The too-late approval of vaccine for the kids means that some grandparents will not get to spend time during the Holidays with their grandchildren.\n\nWe see articles in this publication extoling the benefits of not working and another exhorting us to buy less stuff.\n\nAnd to those who see/know all these things and then express surprise that those in power lose elections, I offer 2 thoughts: (1) you're not paying attention; and (2) you don't know America very well.\n\nOh, B/T/W, this is all without even mentioning CRT...",

Your comments sometime mention \"flyover\" country, with the implication that this the real America.  And yet, people on the coasts - even liberal people on the coasts - scramble to get their children out of the door in the morning, buy groceries, and manage their homes.  Perhaps they see things differently than you, but they are still America.  And the temporary scarcity that you are experiencing in a \"land of plenty\" is part of America, too.  Many Americans live in food deserts and in areas where it is hard to purchase necessities.  America, as Walt Whitman pointed out so long ago, is many things.    The problem is that people tend to assume that their America is somehow the \"real\" America.",

The problems you list are not just governmental inadequacies and no we are not the USSR of 50 years ago. These shortages/problems are the result of business plans in too many industries who outsourced everything possible for more profit, and don't want to pay fair wages here (including truck drivers). The infrastructure has been a point of contention and degrading for a long time, but have you ever heard big business ask/push for improvement? Didn't 'infrastructure week' become a joke for a number of years?  Not a peep from big business about infrastructure, because they don't want to pay for it- they want us to pay for it (while helping boost their bottom lines). Were they the ones who scrambled to set up production of essential pandemic supplies here, after staring in the face of shortages? nope. They waited till they were promised profits for doing so. I would bet that once the ports are cleared and containers moved to places of production for restuffing, and things flow again- there will be no changes in business behavior or philosophy that 'some' things absolutely need to be produced here. There will be no thoughts or actions to ensure these types of shortages etc don't happen again. Sad, but when we live in a corporatocracy, only their bottom line counts.",

Forget at your peril, there's more work to be done, it's a constant fight against the minority enshrined by the Electoral College.

A self-proclaimed “Democratic-socialist” India Walton, won the primary against a 4-term incumbent centrist Democrat, Byron Brown, who really didn’t bother to campaign. Yesterday, he appears to have won on a write-in campaign.\n\nI listened to a long-form interview with Ms Walton, and I admire her tenacity and her commitment to the working poor; however, some of her policy ideas seemed utopian and naive at best, like reducing the police budget by $7.5 million — as crime is increasing nationwide. Not a winning hand.\n\nThough it didn’t come from any Democratic lawmakers as far as I can see, the “defund the police” slogan has absolutely killed the down-ballot Dems in 2020 and continues in 2021. Add to that the GOP’s cynical manipulation of critical race theory — something not even taught in K-12 schools — and moderates ran away.",

The difference is the ultra-slim majority requiring complete consensus. It would be difficult to achieve results no matter what. \n\nThe real problem is Democrats don't know how to fight back when Republicans fight dirty with misinformation, outright false information, and dog whistles. \n\nHate and rage and culture wars will always turn out voters more than anything rooted in actual policy. Trump is the only reason Democrats won anything in the last 5 years. Democrats need to play dirty or they will continue to lose against a party that will do literally anything (see: Jan 6 and post-Jan 6) to get and stay in power.",

NOW, we need infrastructure and some kind of Build Back Better plan that can pass with moderates in swing areas, so that Democrats can start deflecting criticism with policy that works.

Governing is always more difficult for D’s because of this, and the reality is that a laundry list of progressive legislation that is marketed for women, with no specifics being shared  with voters, will not offer the political lift Pramila Jayapal thinks it will. Democrats simply don’t do politics nearly as well as R’s. That is a tragedy unto itself.",

When you add to that redistricting, election rule changes and the trends in party affiliation among Non-White Hispanic voters, and the dynamics for the Democratic Party start to look really, really bad.\n\nThe single consolation is that Trump can only do so much damage in a non-consecutive four year term (which he will win, the way things are currently going) and will probably not get the majorities he needs to amend Presidential term limits. Some consolation…",

In the interview she says race should not be discussed at all in public schools and instead left for parents alone to handle. She is skeptical that concerns about police treatment of young black males has anything to do with the color of their skin. She posits instead that it is because of how they dress and behave and their lack of respect for police. She was stumped when asked how schools can teach the history of slavery without discussing race.\n\nThere may well be room for discussion on exactly how best to teach our complicated history to children. But the truth about the GOP strategy and the VA election is out in the open. It was about preserving a white dominant view of race, not some nuanced discussion of curricula.",

He is in the pocket of Dominion Power for sure - that ad was correct and I don't like him but I voted for him.  When Trump claims that he won the 2024 election in VA when he loses it, the GOP in Virginia from the Governor on down will agree with him and overturn the election and help elect an Autocrat.  That is why I voted for Terry.  I am VERY worried about my country and now my state.  Very very worried.\n\nBut the Democrats need to hire a very good PR and Marketing team.  They do not have that - they never do.  The GOP won there 100 to nothing.  Youngkin may end up being a decent leader, we'll see. But he won by telling the uninformed rural voters that the Democrats teach critical race theory in the schools and they do not.  The Dems could have countered that but they did not - at least not where I live. Sad sad day here in Virginia.",

It doesn't leave out the history of slavery or the Civil War---the facts----rather, it offers a unique perspective, just as the lens of Marxist theory does when applied to economics. It's been around since the 1970s, but enjoying a resurrection today treated as new since most don't know much at all about the facts of history, let alone discuss the facts through the lens of the various historical theories. To use it as the sole lens to teach history to elementary or high school students is akin to teaching them subject matter through a Marxist perspective. Just give more facts, more statistics, regarding the disproportionately in incarceration, greater prosecution of and longer prison sentences of crack over cocaine, and which race uses crack and which cocaine, etc.  As Mark Twain said, \"show, don't tell.\" Let the students discuss the \"facts.\" It will be a lively discussion based on the objective facts standing alone, not just propaganda, no alleged \"shaming.\" There will be no telling what to think, but additional \"facts\" and statistics introduced into the texts will provoke more enthusiasm for the subject matter. It's like teaching the Bible as literature, not as a sacrosanct document.",

Discussing the issue of race in America is very important, and something that can not be avoided in any US history class - it is simply part of our historical record. America is a country founded with the racism that justified slavery, that is not an opinion, it is an obvious fact. Racism played a major role in racial income inequality, that is not an opinion, it is an obvious fact. But CRT is only one perspective on the topic of how to view race in America. Writers such as Glenn Lowry, John McWhorter, and Coleman Hughes are black Americans with quite a different perspective, and frankly, one I find myself far more in line with. It would be great to see their perspectives included in the discussion in schools.\n\nBut I will still never support Republican candidates that align behind the awfulness that is Trump, and those parts of the Republican platform like unlimited gun rights, refusal to collect what is needed from the wealthy in taxes to finance what our country needs, and the movement to force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.",

Will not learn anything from listening except experience the feeling of being hated from one who suffered unjustly from hatred, or it will amplify the hatred already felt by a comparable reader. In contrast, rained out concert in Central Park featured Jon Baptiste's thrilling performance of \"Freedom,\" which brought us together, in the rain. My Progressive era son met him, shook his hand, had brief but etched conversation outside Colbert's studio, after first memorable performance. Son also connected with Spike Lee at airport, who sat beside him in waiting area--Lee is a storyteller who tells the facts with heart that connects to audience of all races. We should build bridges between the races, acknowledging the facts on the ground but not widen the abyss by pushing the hate.",

Most young kids who have gender dysphoria outgrow it (something like 90%) - many of the grow up to be gay. Adolescent-onset GD seems to be influenced by media, social media, and peers, at least to some degree. (Yes really - read the latest research, like the peer-reviewed study on detransitioners that came out a week or two ago). Childhood and adolescence is a time of ever-changing identity development. Parents want schools to stop influencing their kids and then locking them into medicalization that is based on very weak evidence. Parents also want to stop being lied to by schools and divided from their children in the name of social justice. It's real and it's happening and yes even lefty and Democratic parents HAVE HAD ENOUGH.",

Narratives such as CRT are speaking to something.  \"Black lives matter\" was a response to observed incidents. Americans' reactions to the shifting ethnic demographics of the country range from welcoming the shift to buying firearms. American society is divided into castes (cf Isabel Wilkerson).  It has been since the 17th century. For the American experiment to survive, we must address this, accepting as we do so that a portion of the citizenry like this caste system just fine, thank you, and will resist its dismantling, even at the point of a gun. Searching for consensus is one thing.  However, as our demographics continue to change, the choice will become stark:  either a post-racial society, or apartheid.",

Definitely a better education than one received in places where the states/localities limit what can be taught to the narrow strictures of white conservative thought.\n\nAs for the GOP?  A vote for that party in this era is a vote for all that Trump represents and supports.  It's his party now.",

In my opinion, it will illustrate that governing this country isn't worth the effort.  It is surely true that absolutely nothing of value will happen after that.  I guess we'll find out if the Republicans sabotage the government and economy  completely.  Democrats are ill-suited to defeating the demagoguery and contempt coming from that other faction in the country or even the fringe figures like Kendi and DiAngelo. \n\nIf Democrats imagined that their build back better agenda would be popular, they ought to be sufficiently chastened by now to abandon the whole effort and rebrand themselves as a maintainer of the status quo. \n\nAnd if you don't like the status quo?

Judging by the comments in this section and elsewhere, the initial Democratic take on last nights results is to double down on the current Progressive gestalt.  This is a recipe for disaster and the Democrats are going to get completely trounced in 2022.  With respect to the current policy initiatives, the Build Back Better bill is dead.  If the Democrats were smart, they would hold an immediate vote on the Infrastructure Bill and force the Progressives to tow the line.  This of course will not happen.  The game is over.

You may think that these are basic rights but others may not.  My point is that the political leaders have to make the calculation of what will pass and what will not and think through the consequences of failure. It's a bit like a chess match. If you've ever played chess, you know that you have to think 2 or 3 moves ahead which involves understanding the consequences of your moves.  If your goal is to win, these considerations are important.  I believe the Democrats pursued a really bad (as in stupid) strategy.  Last night's report card indicates failure. The consequences are that the outlook for the kinds of policies you think are important is not good.  I don't think it had to end this way but stronger voices thought otherwise.  Now you will have to live with the results.",

All AP teaching materials are chosen by the College Board in Princeton, NJ.  They also design the AP tests that students must take at the end of the semester to earn credit for that AP course.\n\nIf parents dislike what a ￼high school AP English course requires their tender children to read, maybe they should just sign their child up for the basic English class.  Then, of course, the prestige of having taken AP English won’t be on their child￼’s high school transcript to try & impress prospective colleges.  \n\nIn my day there were no fancy AP English courses offered, but we were still required to read some pretty thought-provoking stuff:  Julius Caesar (bloody assassination), ￼MacBeth (revenge, murder & mayhem), A Tale of Two Cities (lots of executions, ends with the hero on his way to the guillotine), Lord of the Flies (young boys resort to savage, primal instincts).",

Content, the former vehicle for informed citizenry and job preparedness, fell by the wayside. As a matter of fact, the very contents of curriculum began and still are roiling not only education but also politics.  Then came testing mandates, which further undermined content, as test preparation took over much class time, but performance was tied to funding. Then the tests were claimed to be biased. \n\nAfter all that, still 40% of US adults don’t read well enough (from decoding to detecting bias) or understand math well enough to succeed in life. what “succeeding in life” means is up for grabs. 40% of arrested insurrectionists have serious financial problems in the recent past suggesting a lack of math skills.  \n\nEducation is key for citizenry and life. The fact CRT isn’t taught in K-12 doesn’t matter when voters don’t recognize bias.",

Terry sounded negative and tired, the other guy fresh and exciting.  Never mind who supported him and who--we don't know yet--will anchor himself to Youngkin's shoulders, not only to claim credit but also to prove his continuing influence.\n\nThat said, Democrats have much to fear because of how splintered the party is, even more than Trump's. We see it not only in Congress, but across the country.  The party desperately needs new blood and energy not only to unite it, but to articulate its message.\n\nThe problem is, these aren't normal times.  So an election might go to Repubicans, but one wonders what happens in all those red states that have taken control of election aministrations.  It's chilling to contemplate.",

The country wants the middle and as long as the Dems are blind to what drives this country (Small gov, low taxes, Capitalism, balanced Social justice, safety net not entitlement), they will cede control to the Republicans and give Trump (a very bad thing) a real opening in 3 years.",

They don't deserve power, and when they get it again in 2023 and maybe 2025 the result could be as catastrophic as Trump's tenure.\n\nThe Democrats have a real dilemma in that the more they embrace sanity, the more progressives will stay home or vote Green. But embracing the progressive agenda, particularly socially, turns off moderate suburban voters. Gerrymandering and the Electoral College are already built in advantages for the GOP. Meanwhile the dithering in DC and the rather shocking incompetence displayed in the way the Afghanistan withdrawal was \"managed,\" together with the fact that the president will be 80 next year, can only provoke tremendous unease among the citizenry. Something akin to Trump II could be in our future, even if Trump isn't at the top of the ticket in 2024.",

There is an appalling lack of white and black men continuing their education after graduating from high school. These disaffected men will cause many problems in the future.\n\nThere are at least 40,000 homeless children in New York living in squalid city shelters.

At the upstate prisons of Sing Sing and Attica 90% of the corrections officers are white.\n\nSay what you like, but the Democratic officeholders would gladly forego re-election if it meant that they could help people now.

However, diversity and multiple opinions apparently does not work well when it comes to Politics. Republican politicians get their main talking points down, along with some local nuanced issue(s) from on high and then repeat. They stick to the script. The Democratic party has to many voices for simplicity in messaging. Democrats in races at the local level (Representative, Mayor, etc.) have a shot,  but in statewide (Senator, Governor) races, moderation and focused messaging apparently seem to work best. \n       There could be a silver lining here. Trump's stench may be fading. Not all Republicans support Trump and a guy like Youngkin was able to get the vote of the more traditional Republican voters, along with Independents. I have no problem with moderate Republicans, if that what Youngkin is.  If he is a DeSantis or Abbott, shame on the voters of Virginia.",

The progressive platform and prejudices are presented and defended on MSNBC, CNN and vilified on Fox News, but no one is explaining the program in detail enough to satisfy the moderates who voted for Biden.\n\n For example, is the money set aside for immigration in BBB to  hire more immigration judges and personnel to process applications, delayed by COVID which shut down consulates? Or it going to be used to pay out lawsuits filed by persons separated from their children for a couple of months under the Trump administration as the WSJ reported may be the case. ( persons employing legal channels wait years for their adoptive children, or relatives)\n\nMany Democrats are concerned about inflation, affecting their everyday lives, which they experience in rising prices at the grocery stores, rental car agencies, and  gas stations. The party hasn't done enough to explain how the BBB is not going to contribute to runaway inflation. Further, many agree that the bipartisan bill should not be held hostage for tactical reasons, but deserves a straight up and down vote immediately. Many are tired of hearing from the strident, autocratic Jayapal (\"Chicken Little\")with two mouths and no ears, whose sole objective appears to be to shove the bill through because she says so and we should take her word for it that the world will fall if we don't do as she says.",

All thinking persons voted for you.\" Stevenson replied \"Thank you, madam, but I needed a majority.\"",

I think Democrats are in favor of an honest telling of history, but they are more interested in infrastructure and climate change.  If you listen to my parents, they think AOC runs the Democratic party.  The Dems really lose on messaging.  The Republicans have perfected the art of lying out loud, over time, about issues that bait folks into fear.  Kids should learn that the US government slaughtered native people, they should learn that slavery was an economic engine for our young country, they should learn about redlining and all the ways that institutions pushed people of color to the margins.  Not because of a political agenda, but because it is the truth.  Students should learn that we can do better, and that telling the truth takes nothing away from white kids and their parents.",

That's why they ran with it. It's a racist dog-whistle issue and they know it.\n\nI learned about slavery and Jim Crow when I was in sixth grade - in 1974. I survived without trauma, as did my classmates. And conservatives don't care about non-white students, except to use them as some kind of device to frighten white voters. The controversy surrounding the non-existent teaching of CRT in public schools it a perfect example.\n\nWhy are white conservatives suddenly snowflakes of the most pathetic sort?

Yes, I agree that drill baby drill certainly creates more working class jobs as does continuing to burn coal.  But how about health care and the minimum wage?  W/o the ACA, the vast majority of low wage workers would lack health insurance.    Wages for blue collar folks are much lower in states with low minimum wages.   States with limits on unions also have lower wages for folks who do the same jobs as others who are represented by unions.  The data is very clear that that the working class has faired poorly over the past 30+ years.  Much is not caused by any political party, but minimum wages, health care and unions clearly help these folks and are the direct result of political decisions.",

Well, looking at the data from 2019--before the pandemic--compared to 2016, I can sum up what the Republicans did for the working class in one word--jobs.  The Republicans provided the working class with work so that they could provide for their families.  In 2019, we had the best employment in the country in over 50 years and the best employment for women and minorities ever.  Also for the first time in many years lower and middle-class Americans began to increase their real income and real wealth.  You may want to concentrate on QAnon and Trumpian nonsense, but the country is moving on.  Youngkin outperformed Trump in every county in Virginia.  A broad majority of Americans--including Democrats, independents, and ersatz Republicans--despise Donald Trump, but that majority does not favor the woke and socialist agenda of the left and has been sorely disappointed by Biden's (and the Democrat's) incompetence.",

A minimum wage takes the bargaining out of the employee/employer relationship over the price of labor. This sets a floor for the wages required were few employers will pay above. Wage stagnation then occurs because the minimum wage is not changed. Having no minimum wage on the other hand requires employers to compete on the low end of wages and allows those to increase overtime naturally. \n\nGovernment healthcare reform is also pointless because every time government gets involved the price of care increases due to new compliance costs and complicated bureaucratic  mechanisms created by these programs. \n\nAs for unions, I am on the fence. However, the current set up is non tenable. Unions should not be granted monopoly power in negotiating with an employer. Just as in the commercial space monopoly power only leads to corrupt practices. \n\nRepublican policies of tax cuts and deregulation when combined have had strong economic effects on the country more so than any redistributive policy. Allowing markets to function with limited interference from government increases efficiency and and allows folks to get access to goods and survives when and as needed.",

Miller \n\nThe first two are wrong on a few levels\n1) Making 7.50 an hour, a person working 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year would make only 15000 dollars per year. This is starvation wage in nearly the entire country. Are you really an employer if you are doing that or are you an exploiter? Are we really losing anything by taking away this possibility?\n\n2) Medicare is one of the cheapest healthcare providers in the country. It has far less bureaucratic overhead than insurance companies. This comes from its ability to negotiate prices on mass (which smaller insurers can't do), its freedom from a profit motive and by using audits rather than prior authorization for spending, which is cheaper and easier. \n\n3) I too am unsure about unions in general. However, I will note that the US has some of the weakest labor and union laws in the developed world. By extension, blaming them for any type of problem is clearly incorrect. If we wanted to change the union situation, more would be the only reasonable way to go, since we are already trying out less right now. \n\n4) Tax cuts for the rich have consistently demonstrated no improvement for the vast majority. Moreover, our corporate taxes are nearly the lowest they have been in a generation nd much much lower than they were in my grandparents day.  and we are having this debate now, If they worked, why would we be debating that now? we have already done it and it hasn't worked.",

There are some folks out there that don’t want uncomfortable subjects taught but many conservatives are ok with critical understandings of history even history as it pertains to race. However there is objection promoting a narrative that race is the defining factor behind every aspect of life that nonwhite individuals and children have no chance and that all white individuals are evil. \n\nNow I am not saying that this is being taught in that manner, but any permeation of that concept can be traumatic for children particularly in developing relationships with their peers across cultural divides. I highly recommend Jon McWhorters book denouncing much of the progressive designs on this style of thought and curriculum. \n\nAnd of course there are ways to study uncomfortable aspects of history without causing too much trouble for children. I was taught a good bit about slavery and Jim Crow in K-12 education and it was done responsibly. I questioned my place in the world but was not going to let the past (which I had no control over) dictate my future.",

Trump isn't responsible for the pandemic, but he did hand Bush a recession and in the three years before the pandemic the budget deficit had increased by $400 billion dollars. But never mind the facts, Republicans continue to sell the idea to gullible voters that they are routinely better on the economy. Now I could mention that Trump didn't win the election, the deaths of thousands from the Covid vaccine have not been suppressed, and CRT is not being taught in public schools.

Spitzer \n\n“Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”\n\n- John Adams\n\nI am not sure where you get yours but you cannot simply talk about deficits and surpluses between presidential administrations and then hope to explain the economic forces under another presidential administration. \n\nWhat is clear however is that Obama is the only modern US President who did not see a single annual GDP increase of 3% or more during his administration. \n\nUnder Trump unemployment was down to record numbers and wages were increasing particularly at the lowest income brackets. The pandemic certainly hurt Trump and the economy but it is foolish to not consider the impact of government action during the pandemic that forced many businesses to shutter and never reopen. It is possible there was another policy that could have kept people safe and allowed more businesses to stay afloat. \n\nGoing back to Bush, the 2008 recession largely resulted from a government policy enacted under the Clinton administration that changed lending rules and allowed for the practice of predatory lending to flourish.  \n\nSo which facts do we follow? Which policies are the right ones? Hard to say, but I am always on the side of liberalism in social and economic spheres. Free society, free trade, free markets, etc.",

A minimum wage system sets a floor. The government says you cannot pay less than X dollars per hour.  This results in the same outcomes as price fixing where employers simply agree to pay or charge a specific amount for specific services. However in this case the government (despite good intentions) creates the floor and causes the subsequent problems of wage stagnation (unless and until the minimum wage is raised again). \n\nAbsent a minimum wage system employers would have to compete for labor. Some folks might get away with paying low wages but not for very long if employees can find good work for good wages elsewhere. That’s called market forces and they would more reliably set the price labor more so than anything government can do.",

In cases of big businesses like Walmart, the person offering the employee the contract won’t even have the authority to modify the contract on their own anyhow.\n\nAlso, your assumption that employers would compete with each other  to offer workers a better working condition doesn’t hold up that well when we are talking about low skilled workers. The employers just offer similar conditions, which tend to benefit them all precisely because they don’t have to compete with each other to give employees better conditions. Low skilled workers, unfortunately, tend to be more replaceable than others, and employers tend to care less about motivating them with better conditions.",

He could die tomorrow and 25% of the population will still think he will be reinstated as president soon.  \n\nSure, if you can visibly help those people, you can win votes.

My grandfather said plenty of racist things but he was a very good person, beloved by many people. It is just that he grew up in an all-white town in a certain period in time.

A year into the Biden administration, the ability to lead and legislate seems inept, with fractured Democrats flailing this way and that while failing to reach the end zone. The message it sends to voters, like it or not, is that they are incompetent.\n\nVoters, aside from repudiating Donald Trump in 2020, voted for competence and kindness in government. Joe Biden's decades of experience, not to mention his affability, offered at least the potential for that, but for many Americans, affability isn't cutting it, and frustration is building.\n\nThere is a growing perception that Joe Biden simply isn't tough enough, and that his innate predisposition to patiently kill 'em with kindness doesn't cut it. With the mid-term elections quickly approaching, it does not bode well for Democrats.

Loudon being able to meet in-person is an exception); the clumsy way that \"Crucial Conversations\" (the local version of critical race theory-informed curricula) was rolled out; the removal of honors classes and advanced math; and finally, the prioritization of transgender ideology above the rights of girls to single-sex spaces.  \n\nFinally, I was disgusted at how the Democrats talked about the rape (not alleged; her rapist was convicted) of a girl in a Loudon County school bathroom by a boy (identifying as various genders over time) who, because of defacto self-ID, was not challenged for being in a formerly single-sex space for girls. The school board covered it up, and Democrats insulted the girl and her father every chance they got. Who became the villain in all this, worthy of FBI/Dept of Justice scrutiny? Parents.\n\nGood luck in the midterms, Democrats.",

The real problem are well-meaning ed school graduates, who are generally not very nuanced thinkers but shape the college and intellectual experience of undergraduates much more than professors do - and whose proliferation across campus is the main reason why college is now over $80k a year at many top schools.",

But you would not know that from Youngkin.  An incident about a Toni Morrison novel that happened a decade ago was a campaign theme that really is about White fears. \n\nYoungkin also used another fable of the transgender student assaulting a girl in a public school bathroom as an indictment of tolerance to transgender kids.  It turned out that the kid at issue was not transgender.  In any event, this crime is not the responsibility of the governor but rather of local police and DA and the courts which handled it.\n\nSadly I believe Youngkin will block my State from having better climate change legislation and gun safety laws.  He is a pro-business billionaire who will favor continued coal mining and natural gas in my state and will try to reverse our recent gun safety laws like universal gun buyer background checks.",

Clintonism is a dead duck. \n\n2. Democratic Party political leadership is incompetent, and needs to be replaced.\n\nAbsent recognition of those two points, upcoming midterms are shaping up as a political disaster for the nation. \n\nThat die may already be cast. Democratic Party progressives ought to forget the mid-terms, and instead organize an activist push to take over in 2024. As an organizing idea, rescuing the middle class is way more powerful than slip-sliding toward another defeat.",

They are deeply afraid of introspection and discomfort. The GOP understands that this fear is easy to activate and adapts their messages accordingly. They call on voters' fight-or-flight reactions. It's not new, it's not complicated, and it's pervasive in white communities (even yours, Mr. and Ms. Prius).",

Suppose further that right-thinking people - those in education, say, agree with you.  How would you expect that agreement to manifest itself in how they do their jobs?  Would you anticipate any political consequences to this?\n\nOn my side of the aisle, you appear to be making the second half of the \"There's no such thing as CRT... and it's awesome!\" argument.  The first comment I read here seems to capture the first half - paraphrasing: \"my history-teaching daughter is being persecuted by the yahoos (in Massachusetts) merely for teaching a unit on African history.\"  I am skeptical.  I wish that commentator would provide some more background.  I'm guessing this unit dealt with colonialism in Africa; whether an American parent in 2021 would take that teaching personally depends a lot on how straight a line one is attempting to draw between then and now.",

Douthat said it specifically: “Democrats need to find a new way to talk about education.” \n\nThe so-called “critical race theory” is not a K-12 issue.  It’s only taught in a few of the country's leading law schools. Those law schools are “leading” because they are preparing their students to fight the cases that are going to crowd future court dockets as historians uncover more of America’s racial malfeasance. They are preparing lawyers to argue on both sides of the issues.\n\nIn trying to put an objective face on the Democrats loss in Virginia, I can hear Douthat’s pleasure in the fact that his side won; even though America may have lost.\n\nWhite parents won the fight against public school desegregation, but the win destroyed the public schools and the poor’s path to the middleclass.\n\n“God bless America.”",

What does that say to the Black student who who wants to do well in school?   \n\nWhen we hear that \"white supremacy...is maintained and upheld by EVERYONE who holds white privilege...\"  (Layla Saad, in her bestselling book \"Me and White Supremacy\") how are the white schoolchildren and their parents who believe that racism and white supremacy are deeply repugnant likely to feel?

The fact is that contesting such material is problematic,, not in the ideal, but in the pragmatic consideration.\nNot a small number of the GOP and others are hungry for the 'red meat' and when it is tossed to them, the ability to swallow it down whole is quite set already and the likelihood of either preventing the meal or of altering its savor is difficult if not already defeated.  \nThe people of the Old South may allow statues to be removed, but may hold grudges and they may claim to be open minded.    A good many may truly be so, but getting there is not always without reversals of feeling or scruples in the matter.    What is more tolerant today can perhaps backslide a bit tomorrow.  \nGetting to some point of easy freedom from the past is difficult.

I've always seen liberals, with their emphasis on individuals and identity as it relates to capitalist societies, as a conservative even backward tendency. MLK and Malcolm X represented actual progressive, left, working class movements, but CRT coming as it did out of the elite academies is hardly left or progressive. It's more consistent with illiberalism with its emphasis on identity and \"personal lived experience\", as a source for canceling and shaming.",

Whenever I hear these complaints or concerns, the thought that percolates in the back of my head is, \"good.\"  Slavery and Jim Crow should make you uncomfortable because they are, in fact, uncomfortable.  Learning about the Holocaust should make you uncomfortable because the mass slaughter of millions should shock anyone who is not a sociopath.  To those who object to the teaching of these subjects, I would ask a simple topic:  How should they be taught?  You can say, \"Oh, it's the past,\" but there are many living people who came of age under Jim Crow.  You can say, \"Oh, they're aberrations.\"  But slavery was the cornerstone of the economy and de jure Segregation lasted for anywhere from 50 to 80 years after emancipation.

When the subject of slavery was taught, almost all of the kids in the class were interested, were thrilled to hear how their forebearers arrived, lived, worked & died. Many related family stories about the experience of slavery. It was an extremely positive experience for the kids as well as the community as a whole. \n\nLet's just say it out loud - there is a portion of the US population that embraces a fallacious  narrative - whether it's masking the Civil War as \"Northern Aggression\" or attributing certain characteristics to racial/religious groups. There is also another portion of the population that abets &/or tolerates it in order to manipulate it for extraneous purposes - political, of course.\n\nCalling prejudice \"discomfort\" is unacceptable, nothing more than a \"big lie\".

Some parents want comforting stories about well-treated slaves or white southern moderates or progressives who were always [secretly] pulling for the Freedom Struggle.  In point of fact, both slavery and Jim Crow had the overwhelming support of white citizens and the muscular backing of the state.   Something similar happens in discussions of the Holocaust, where people must confront the truth that majority of people in central and eastern Europe were willing to support the Nazis or at least willing themselves to be ignorant of what was happening.   For every Bonhoeffer, there were dozens of German Christians who happily shot innocent men, women, and children.  These are had facts to confront at any age.",

Discussions of racism and the legacy of slavery and territorial conquest in America was barely touched on. The political and cultural upheavals taking place outside schools were our “teachers”. The classroom was where I learned the very superficial outlines of history and geography..and of course…how to read and write and do math.\nWhat I will say was that the overlying mission of elementary school history education was anti-communism. To that end, most “history” education of the period tended to frame the conflicts of the 19th and 20th centuries as conflicts against some form of totalitarianism…even when the actual roots were far more complex. Nuance and critical thinking was not prized. That was reserved for college. The goal of school was to churn out obedient “good citizens”.\nBTW…with nuns getting on your case all the time, the whole notion of making kids “comfortable” was not really valued, at least as I recall.",

Check out OUP's \"Debating American History\" series. The answer is not to pick one side or the other; the answer is to teach the debate, provide primary sources and secondary arguments, and then make the kids take positions and defend them.  I set up the 1619 Project as target practice.  Kids can defend it or attack.  The grade is based on writing, use of evidence, and argument.  \n\nWe don't want a right wing textbook, but we don't want a left wing textbook either.",

Civil Rights and Slavery have been part of the curriculum (even in Mississippi, I hope) for much longer than that. That parents are complaining just recently shows how effective the GOP strategists are at finding the social/cultural issue du jour and with the help of FOX and other propaganda outlets make it election deciding issues. Case in point, even though I consider myself pretty well read, ‘Critical Race Theory’ was not in my vocabulary until very recently. Look, even if Democrats totally eliminate cultural issues, as worthy as they are, from their platform, the GOP will always find the one or the other to whip up their base, because they have nothing else to run on. Democrats just have to make sure to counter this by delivering on the important issues when they are in power. But if they can’t even convince Manchin to support fining methane leaks, one of the easiest steps to avert global climate catastrophe, they get what they deserve.",

If it is taught well, it will afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.  The extremists on the left continue to insist that we right the wrongs of the past.  We cannot undo the injustices of the past.  The problem with the movement to require Ethnic Studies as a graduation requirement (which California￼’s governor recently signed into law and is laced with Critical Race Theory), is that students of most backgrounds will be marginalized and feel “less than.”  \n\nJust teach history with all of our warts so our children can grow up with a knowledge and understanding of our past and the hope they will not repeat those glaring acts of inequality that were made by our ancestors.",

It's more complex than a couple of statements, but to me, it's very important both that we all learn to see that our actions affect others in ways we don't know, and that racist thoughts and actions abide.  The people who are 'intensely concerned' seem either offended - the whole 'but I'M not racist' or 'that was in the past' attitude - or willfully ignorant (and some, racist).  The people who support the new method, or curriculum, generally seem to me to be humble, and interested in working through our country's issues.

Of course, this was in western NYS and they did conveniently pretend we had done all we could with the Civil War and it was up to the South to get its own act together. But nevertheless, history was not sugarcoated. And we were expected--in fact, assigned--to read conflicting versions of history as early as 8th grade. Getting real is nothing new.

Maybe there are a few die-hards in Ol' Miss, but your characterization of these parents is beyond the pale, and it's exactly why they're getting angrier.  See Sam Wineburg and Chauncey MonteSano's list of 10 Great Americans, published in the Journal of American History, where surveys of people on the street resulted in top 10 lists with Oprah Winfrey and Harriet Tubman at the very top, a direct outcome of the deep embedding of civil rights into state teaching practices -- civil rights education is the core of social studies and has been for almost 2 decades.  You can view the curricula of any state and see this.  Of course teachers can modify what they're told to teach, but you can't teach that master narrative by populating it with contented slaves, not by a long shot.",

My husband and I were on a tour of a plantation in S. Carolina a few years ago and were stunned to hear the tour guide say that \"a change in the labor situation\" caused the viability of the plantation to go down hill.  That was how he described the end of slavery.  We looked around and no one batted an eye.",

The attacks on merit based admission to the top schools in Virginia flipped alot of Asians from D to R.  They don't want to ban the teaching of Civil Right history. They want the ideology of identity politics and CRT NOT in the classroom.",

As ever, play-it-safe democrats fail to understand the important difference between primaries and elections and succumb to pressure from the part leaving democratic voters again with someone to vote against rather than for. Republicans were far more excited about their candidate and Black voters were not feeling mobilized by McAuliff. Candidates spoke in the coded partisan language of fear rather than on detailed issue agendas which could have made a difference as well.  Still, its close and al the votes are not yet counted",

That's the extent of his evidence of unsettling \"ideas filtering into ... kids' classrooms in the last few years.\"  Maybe critical race theory and its penumbra is more than a boogeyman, but Douthat hasn't proved it.

McAuliffe walked right into this culture war, which the GOP will ALWAYS win among the wider public, instead of neutralizing it. He also tried to paint Youngkin as Trump, which the latter easily parried by sounding normal and minimizing association with the orange-haired kakistocrat. \n\nIf Dems let their progressive wing assert the wrong lessons from this, they will get swept next year.",

Kendi or Robin DiAngelo, those ideas are filtering down to everyday people. Is there some outright racism involved in this backlash against progressivism? Of course, but two things can be true at once. There can be, on the one hand, an overreaction to teaching a more complicated history leading voters to reject Democratic platforms writ large, and on the other a legitimate argument that woke progressivism turns off even those people who are not card-carrying KKK members. The truth is that even though the Republican party has done very well at turning this into political victory in Virginia (and maybe more), Democrats have done very poorly at communicating that US history, for example, simply needs a fuller telling. At local levels, of course, politics is often more nuanced, but leadership at the top has got to find a way to communicate a more welcoming platform to people whose lives are simply too busy and anxious to deal with a kind of political message that mostly only academics and administrations at universities bathe in. You don't have to like this reality, but people do not want to be told they are inherently racist, which is what they're hearing.",

Terry McAuliffe, an establishment fund raiser par excellence, was hardly an inspiration to the Virginia masses struggling with the daily realities of neo-feudal America and Virginia; the fresh face won the race, and McAuliffe was a retread. Democrats need better candidates.\n\n2. 'Wokeness' is a catastrophe at the ballot box; tens of millions of Americans will vote Republican just because political correctness annoys them; if Democrats cannot speak more than two sentences without invoking the 'people of color' phrase and similar expressions, they will continue to be obliterated at the ballot box; turn off the 'wokeness' switch or lose.\n\n3. The Manchin-Sinema Senate iceberg has successfully gouged a massive hole in the Democratic Party; if Biden, Schumer, Pelosi don't find a quick way to reel in this billionaire front man and front woman opposed to tax increases, voting rights, a decent safety net and sensible climate and environmental policy, then welcome to an endless royal Republican flush.\n\n4. Republican Machiavelli's are masters at dividing and conquering the masses on newly invented and recycled culture wars, not to mention masters of disinformation; the only antidote to Grand One Percent public policy and Grand Old Propaganda messages is good bread and butter Democratic policy that helps ordinary Americans with wages, healthcare, infrastructure and a strong economy.\n\nWake up, Democratic Party.\n\nYour Titanic is sinking.",

Again, another example that the republicans are fighting a war, where nothing is fair. Voter suppression, constant messaging filled with lies, filling up local government, gerrymandering, holding up Senate confirmations, etc...as democrats argue nonsensically between themselves, republicans use it against us.  I wish the Dems would wake up and think practically for a change...and agree, the woke politics is aggravating.  I feel sorry for the next generation, the America to be proud of is disappearing fast, no more going to the moon, just a bunch of robber barons stealing from the treasury making their friends rich, dark days ahead.",

Liberal media continues to fail us, but especially social media. McAuliffe cowered under lies, as Dems do. Dems could pass legislation for the starving masses, but choose to shirk in fear of bullies within their own party. This is not new to history, this is how the wrong types of leaders grow in power.

Ralph Nader runs in Florida and takes 93,000 votes away from Gore, who needs just a couple hundred. Hilary has Ivy Leaguers issuing arcane white papers while Republicans hew to a down-to-earth and disciplined messaging campaign. Just recently Colorado Dems agree to the Republican's trojan horse proposal to have a neutral committee draw the gerrymander lines, costing them critical seats they easily could have had. Now Trump is in the catbird seat, ready to take over in 2024 and end any semblance of democracy. And the hapless Dems are totally responsible. What a travesty!",

However, when it comes to dealing with the right wing’s strategy of repeating lies to win elections, I honestly don’t know how you battle that. The right has ALWAYS relied on fear - of blacks, of gays, of foreigners, of  truth- to win and now with the media in their pocket these fear messages saturate the society more easily than ever before. It is a sad day for truth in Virginia.",

We have a racist past and a very evident racist present.\n\nThe republican party has shown itself ready, willing and now able to exploit this problem. This will  redound to the benefit of the haters. Not only will we continue to ignore our racist ways but a host of other problems like immigration, climate change, voting rights, education, and healthcare will go unaddressed.\n\nThis latest meaningless salvo in the culture wars has proven to be an effective way for republicans to get votes...but to what end? They offer anger and chaos but no solutions. \nAt the end of the day, the goal of governance is the improvement of the lot of those governed...both materially and spiritually.

What they want is for institutionalized racism to continue to flourish and for us to teach a very sanitized version of of U.S. History that ignores the fact that this country was founded not on some noble ideal but on overwhelming greed,  genocide and slavery. What these “moderate” voters want is an ultra conservative alternative to the GOP. Most of these people have way more in common with McConnell and Trump than they do with actual Democrats. So I guess we as a party have a choice. We can either continue to fight for what we believe in or we can do what the “moderates” want and start mirroring the far right.",

What has changed in the last 30 years since I was in grade school is that back then it was just accepted that the public schools in mainstream suburban areas taught ideas about living in a secular pluralistic society, and that our country had a bad history when it came to race and poverty and the marginalized.  That was just the accepted shared understanding of the world.  What has changed is that starting with the influence of people like Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich de intellectualizing the conservative movement, the idea that we have shared responsibility for the ills of the structures and systems of society has no longer pervades.  Please do some research to look at what is taught in classrooms now vs 1980, 1990, 2000 before peddling this false narrative that has been constructed to win elections.",

The questioned issue is as Mr. Douthat has said correctly here the \"overlapping ideas of figures like Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo...\" \n\nBecause this is called \"antiracism\" in the current language and nobody can have any objections against fighting racism this in the proper \"positive\" meaning of the word the political opponents have chosen \"Critical Race Theory\" for target as the ideological basis of these ideas. This is very welcomed because in opposite of the traditionally positively connotated term \"antiracism\" granting some kind of halo to the activists the term \"CRT\" has many negative connotation as far left leftist, academic and highbrow. Due to the widespread American academic bad habit of \"moral framing\" of the definition of most of the relevant terms it became a \"war on framing\" also. This is twisting the debate even further. \n\nWhile progressives just tried to shrug off the whole debate by the hair splitting argument that CRT isn´t taught conservatives had understood this word correctly as a \"proxy term\" for an entire erroneous trend in academics, media and society they were able to hit much better.",

No modern educators teach that the world is 6,000 years old or that Columbus' brought civilization to the New World.  Furthermore, sentient beings in America and the world have long known our constitutional flaw and it's repercussions in our society, and recognize education is the healthiest way  to bring about needed change.  And while specific details may be understood at  different ages, there is nothing about the American history of Africans that Americans need to be shielded from, and very little that need be watered down. The holocaust is taught by middle school, but many students already have a working familiarity with the topic by then.   The debate, as you put it, was instigated by right-wing parents and the 'elite' politicians who stood to gain from their ire, discomfort and miseducation. If Virginia took a step back with this election, it just means the Republican political machine still operates effectively enough on the miseducated and fearful.  But the arc of justice is too strong of a natural element to be suppressed forever, and the eked-out win in Virginia also speaks to the new millions refusing to be lied to or have information suppressed. Misguided angers and half-clever 'intellectual' cover-ups make you Right, not right. And when the fairy dust settles, all that's left...is the truth.",

Couple that with more progressive perspectives getting air time than centrist perspectives and you have a perfect combination of overreaching ideas and bad communication thereof.

The sad thing is, most Americans agree with most Democratic policy prescriptions, on topics ranging from gun control to increased social services and taxing the very rich. But with the two factions of the party fighting over the very agenda they put together, voters focus on the chaos and the badly communicated, fringe cultural ideas and make their decisions.",

I would guess that no more than a handful of people voting against it could even tell you what it is. Ibram X. Kendi? I've never even heard of this person, but his/her name alone is enough to send palpitations to the hearts of conservative voters. Attacking \"Beloved\"? OK, maybe it  shouldn't be a high-school level read beyond AP classes, but it sure makes a nice target when your audience thinks being called a racist is far worse than actual racism.\n\nI don't know what the answer is, because appealing to raw emotion can't be intellectually analyzed. But I hope some thoughtful and tactical Democrats and consultants wake up this morning and figure something out, because this is what the midterms and 2024 will look like. \n\nAnd if I've learned one thing above all in those thirty-four years of voting, it's that many white voters (I myself am a white man) seldom resist the pull of the subtle and sometimes not-too-subtle racist appeal.",

We are tired of being divided by race and gender and tired of having our children indoctrinated at school instead of being educated. And for Gods sake please stop talking about Donald Trump. Yes, there is a core Trumpian  constituency but the majority of Republicans and Independents have moved on. Last night that is all the main stream media could talk about ....Trump and racial issues as excuses for the results. America will be dead in the water unless we move the needle to the center. Most of the electorate from both parties are on the forty yard line and unless we realize that our country will continue to be in turmoil and we will continue to fall further behind our competitors on the world stage.",

Here are the lessons:\n\n1) Culture War contrivances (anti-CRT, anti-BLM), especially those with racial undertones are astonishing effective, and especially effective at putting Democrats on the defensive.\n\n2) Democrats continuously blunder and fail to muster any kind of organized defense and counterpunch to these culture wars.\n\n3) Democrats tend to lack any offense in general to take the culture wars to Republicans and keep them off balance. Democrats are too nice. Republicans just simply make stuff up and then go with it. With Democrats, they want to sit down and give you a lecture/thesis on a topic, when in reality, American voters only have the attention span for about 10 second soundbytes.\n\n4) Democrats in congress, with the mixed messaging and back and forth, delays, obstructionism on infrastructure/BBB, come off as a disorganized mess, and this has downsteam negative impacts to Democrats at the state/local level. Voters notice this and\n\n5) Democrats should be blaming inflation, economic woes, etc on stubborn GOP efforts to cause chaos and their refusals to fight COVID, which are impacting global supply chains.",

Manchin and Sinema will divide the party even more, insuring nothing gets done, and the infighting will be relentless.\n\nBut the biggest leadership failure, Nancy Pelosi, will not be replaced. Listening to Pelosi is almost tortuous. She rambles, fumbles, and bumbles rather than use her position to hold republicans accountable for their many misdeeds.\n\nIf this campaign was the best democrats could produce, it's time to welcome Republicans and a second return to the Dark Ages.",

The candidate got elected and Trump is blowing his horn about how important he is. In Oct 2020, Trump committed a major gaffe and Pelosi took to the air to criticize him. She wore a mask so thick no one could hear her. Her comments were all over the place, she was completely un-focused. If we want to avoid another Trump debacle in the white house, we need to fix all of the mistakes. Sending an 81 year old Grandma into mortal combat makes no sense given the plethora of quality spokeswomen readily available in the party.",

Perhaps the people writing this type of comment could, if only for a moment, consider that many Virginians are so tired of the Democrats (i.e. the party of hyper-wokism, forever Covid restrictions, and now inflation) that Youngkin seemed palatable. Perhaps they could examine how their attitudes contribute to alienation from independents. So many educated Democrats like to think of themselves as the enlightened ones on issues of race and class but don't have a clue. \n\nThe Democrats have become what they used to despise. Not so long ago, they billed themselves as the party of openness, acceptance, tolerance, and inclusivity, a refreshing contrast with the religious Right which sought to lecture Americans on what it meant to be a good person. Now, it is Democrats, consumed by the religion of modern-day antiracism, who moralize at the electorate as to what it means to be a good person. The only difference is that the virtues they promote aren't Christian ones, they are antiracist ones as defined by progressive thinkers like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ibram X. Kendi.\n\nPeople seem to be surprised that telling voters \"You must support (X policy position) if you truly want to be an antiracist\" inspires a backlash on the other side. I suspect ordinary Americans don't like having their views dictated to them from the progressive Left anymore than they enjoyed it when it came from the religious Right.",

Douthat's column was important because too many progressives have dismissed the Republican CRT argument because \"it isn't literally being taught in schools\". Most people know that's a stretch, and understand that what was, not so long ago, viewed as a left-wing framework for analyzing how race affected the law is now taught to our kids as capital T Truth. Oppression/privilege are taught as realities rather than analytical frameworks. Many Democrats do not agree with this, and yet the strategy has been \"let's ignore it and talk about how bad Trump/QAnon is\" and just hope it will go away. Sound familiar? That's because it's ​exactly what the GOP does in its rhetoric re: Trump and the Democrats. \n\n\nMy point is,  maybe try to understand what motivates the people who vote in a way you so abhor before substituting your own view of them (i.e. that they're irredeemable racists, corporatists, etc.).

We need to stop giving them so much power, come back down to reality, and start focusing on fixing the root causes of inequalities instead of accusing anyone who even slightly disagrees as bigoted, sexist, racist, or homophobic.

This isn't (well, it shouldn't be) a political issue. It's science. Don't like the restrictions, get a vaccine and mask up until it's not much of an issue.\n\nAs for inflation, seriously? Biden has been in office for like 9 months. There's literally not a single economic policy that could have been enacted within 9 months that would produce this type of inflation. It is impossible.\n\nNow, the Fed (which Biden doesn't have control over, other than making appointments) could increase interest rates.

Economists like Larry Summers and Des Lachman were warning about this in early 2021 but most Democratic politicians have fully bought into modern monetary theory. I'm not blaming Biden personally, but it's not unreasonable to blame Democratic policy writ large for what should have been a foreseeable issue.\n\nAs for the covid restrictions, I am vaccinated and mask up in indoor spaces. But what is the endgame? Why are only Republicans talking about an offramp for masking in schools? From my very liberal Twitter feed, it seems like many on the left are content to stay \"vaxxed and masked\" for the indefinite future and thus there's no sense of urgency to wind down restrictions. Even broaching this subject in many Democratic-leaning forums gets you eye rolls and shrugs, as if mandatory masking has no social costs on a population, especially for kids. A California study showed that vaccination rates, not the reinstitution of mask mandates, limited the impact of Delta.",

Thank you progressives and the liberals who cower to them. Each member of the squad has an F for bringing bills to the floor and none have one bill they have passed. Yet, we bend to them. Why? I believe because they are women. We have grown obsessed by a poisonous message of not challenging any woman ever for fear of being called misogynistic.  \nThe topics these politicians are stuck on, socialism, anti police, gender, race, are all designed to simply remove white men from power and conversations. I'll leave my party because of it. Cancel culture came from the left. It is designed to eliminate differing opinions, a healthy sign of democracy. Yet they shout that it is hate speech, a clear weaponization of freedom.  They are dangerous and democrats have enabled and fueled this crazy divisiveness.",

Fox News is constantly criticizing them.  Instead of heeding Fox’s literal message, Democratic Party leaders need to take note of the conservative panic that drives the criticism.

It's easy to place the blame on progressives but truth is the only message being reported is tailored by corporations who want to keep thigs the way they are. Nothing is going to change in this country because wealthy white people don't want it to. When push comes to shove white people circle the wagons to keep the status quo and if that means losing our democracy than I guess they're ok with that.",

Progressives should be held responsible for making the election closer than it should have been.\nNPR did say that the high increase in crime explained the rejection of change the woke wanted. But they ended the piece with the fight for justice (or words to that effect) continues.\nThere it is. If you don't think their way your against justice, or your a racist(even if you're black).\nThey can't see that their ideology turns off liberals and others who are against racism.\nThey are trump's secret weapon.",

In Alabama, we have areas of the state where it is more common to be stuck in concrete than not. Republicans understand that you cannot throw abstract concepts like CRT at America’s entire population, and we’d be wise to understand it too.",

Like Charlie Brown after Lucy swift-boats him for the umpteenth time, they take their lumps and then go right back to kicking the same football.   \n\nDemocrats have never invested in messaging people without college degrees nearly as much as Republicans do, and for the sake of the country, that has to change.  The evidence is ugly but undeniable:  this is NOT a nation where  truth and reasonable solutions to burning problems sell themselves.  In the United States, reason and sound governance must be packaged, marketed, and sold every bit as much as lies and chicanery already are.\n\nIf that bitter pill offends you, I empathize, but Democrats need to swallow it now if they're going to save this nation from the catastrophic misrule of petty grifters.  We can't afford to lose our children's futures to environmental collapse and racism run amok just because we were too proud or enlightened to stoop to plain-spoken \"messaging.\"",

These books are pretty basic, and the concepts in them are fairly simple. \n\nFor Kendi, the core of his argument is that being quiet and getting out of the way of the status quo is not \"not racist\" enough; you must be actively anti-racist. The status quo is a system where Black men are jailed at a rate of 2:1 to white men (and this is in spite of their making up a much smaller segment of the population to begin with).\n\nFor Di Angelo, the argument is that white people will go to great lengths to avoid talking about race or racism, because they view themselves as the racial default and have accepted a message that society is now effectively \"raceless.\" \n\nI think the left should just take the bull by the horns and say yes, ideas developed in academia have worked their way \"down\" to the non-expert public and are now part of our discourse. But you need some kind of tool or language or analysis to talk about a country where segregation is resurgent (at least in places where integration ever made any real headway in the first place), where Black students underperform on supposedly objective standardized tests, and where it's clearly more dangerous to be a Black person in a traffic stop than pretty much anyone else.",

Those people “threatened” by racial history are those who do not want to acknowledge that this nation was founded on genocide and slavery (not to mention the subjugation of unpropertied women).  The Constitution formalized this racism, but the Constitution also created a means to reverse it.  Douhardt’s lesson that Progressives should shut-up about this past if they wish to win in 2022 is another invitation to authoritarian and “Big Lie” rule; it is also an affront to those Americans and their forbears to who fought to open the Constitution to all.",

Youngkin played on this.  A flag from the violent January 6th insurrection was honored on his rally platform.  This was the flag of the new Confederacy.\n\nCRT as an issue was as much an engineered right wing fantasy smear as claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring out of a Washington pizza place.  Of course she didn’t, and of course many people know that CRT isn’t actually taught in schools or don’t even know what it is. \n\nFor a Southern strategy, just rant about racism, especially about polluting the pure white minds of American youth.  The problem with this for the GOP future is young people are actually multicultural, tolerant and diverse.  Their parents buy into this, but they won’t.\n\nThis is simply a new Confederate monument issue but on the pedestal is the white washed curriculum of the American past.

Democrats are in charge but not in charge of the narrative or law enforcement or the courts. Democrats gave the narrative to Republicans when they failed to immediately hold accountable the officials in charge of protecting the Capitol on 1/6, and those who “decided” to let the insurrectionists go home. 1/6 is an icon to Democratic incompetence and spinelessness. The world watched Republicans endorse the insurrection with their vote to deny certification of the election. Then the world witnessed all Republicans kneel to Trump. The world witnessed Republican obstruction and Democratic impotence. Americans do not want careful cowards to lead. Who in the Democratic Party can lead?",

Republicans will now continue to win, not on economic matters since they cannot pass any meaningful legislation either( unless it's to disenfranchise women or minorities)But on their consistent message of white spite and resentment. It's clearly a winning strategy.\n\nWhen the planet soon becomes uninhabitable due to ignoring climate change and families can no longer afford health or child care and the roads and bridges are impassable due to crumbling infrastructure, we can all rejoice because our children did not learn about slavery in school.",

It assumes that there is more to Trump and Trumpism than just cultish adoration of a man.  As such  Trumpism cannot exist without Trump, certainly not with the same strength.\n\nThe win of Youngkin is the harbinger of something entirely different. Regardless whether Youngkin wanted Trump to campaign in person for him or not, Trumpism has won.  No reasonable observer can possibly argue that  Youngkin did not win because of a clear affinity to Trump.\n\nThis is really bad news and something McConnell and his consorts have been waiting for: the Republicans will swipe the midterms and Trump will win 2024.  What makes the news really bad (for people like me, not for republicans of course) is that it paves the way for the end of democracy in the USA.  Whether it is going to be in the form of a emperor/king or \"just\" a dictator, remains to be seen!",

Democrats should have been concentrating on winning seats at this level and thus putting the structure in place for future governance. Now they've lost at the top in VA and NJ and again at the bottom.\n\nDems are clearly in the process of effectively ceding control of the levers of political power to the GOP.  The process will be nearly complete in 2022 when the GOP takes back the Senate and quite likely the House as well. That will pave the way for the former guy to return gloriously to the White House. \n\nFrankly, the lack of strategic thinking by Democrats has made it all but impossible for the party to remain relevant form this point forward. Dems will likely remain in control only in some major urban areas, blue islands slowly being submerged in the raging national sea of red.",

First off Ross, Critical Race Theory is not taught in any K-12 public school curriculums at least not to my knowledge. It's definitely not taught in any Virginia public school. What the Republicans are doing, and what Douthat is clearly endorsing, is using fear mongering and ginning up white resentment to win elections. \n\nThat said, Virgina is really close to DC and the dysfunction that the Democrats have been mired had to have some effect on how Virginians viewed Terry McAuliffe who is a boring middle of the road candidate. Biden and the Congressional Democrats dysfunction and failing to deliver on anything Biden promised. Biden ran on bringing back some form of order to DC and it's been anything but.\n\nBy the way Ross Douthat leaves out that Republicans are not interested in governing or solving problems. In fact it's the opposite. They are interested in power authoritarianism.",

And the party in power will always take the heat for current events that in reality they had little chance to alter (Delta variant). I didn't even have to watch the media's sporting event treatment of the elections. The fact that Biden was down to 42 percent showed me that suburban voters wouldn't come to his rescue this time. Who knows which way the wind will blow in 6 months. Hopefully by then the Dems will learn to fight harder, hone their message, and start calling Republicans \"fascists.\" Yes, you know the ones who keep saying the Dems are creeping socialists.

If the Presidential election had been held yesterday and it was Youngkin v Warren, I wouldn't have voted. \n\nFundamentally, I believe that America is special because it was founded on the still radical (now understood in modern terms) premise that all people are created equal. But woke progressives no longer believe that premise. They believe that certain people of the right skin color deserve compensation and extra rights that others do not get by virtue of historical wrongs perpetrated on their ancestors.\n\nWoke progressives also believe that people who suffer more recent or even present wrongs, such as people with non-hetero sexual orientation and Muslims, should be treated more equally than others. They turn a blind eye to Asians who suffered grievous wrongs in the past and continue to suffer very real racism today.\n\nWe should teach the racism and genocide that this country was built upon. But we should also recognize that America is special because of its founding premise of equality, a premise that attracted the best and brightest from all over the world, a premise that made America great. \n\nDemocrats need to get back to basis. \n\n\"All people are created equal.\" Not, \"Some people are more equal than others because of the past.\"",

On abortion you hear Republicans say Democrats want unrestricted third term abortions.  On taxes they say that tax cuts pay for themselves.  On deficits they say a lot when a Democrat is president but nothing when a Republican is president.  On climate change they say any amount of nonsense.  The list is long.\n\nTrump was a result of Republicans' tolerance of, or even reliance on, fundamental dishonesty in their political rhetoric.\n\nI think Douthat knows this.  I think that he, like Republicans generally, values his political priorities more than he values simple honesty.  Perhaps Democrats share this trait, but not to the extent Republicans do, if only because Democratic positions are generally more popular than Republican positions.",

So unless you're going to say that Chuck Robb's win in 1981 was a rebuke to Reagan, be careful making too much of this.\n\nBut what we have here is the Democrats being all things to all critics:  McAuliffe lost because Biden is unpopular for pushing a big social-welfare bill.  No, he's unpopular because he hasn't pushed it enough.   No, it's COVID (which is bizarre given all that Biden has done in the face of resistance from nihilist GOP governors).  No, it's inflation (a global phenomenon).  Or apparently it's teaching schoolkids that the United States has done terrible things to non-White people over its history, and perhaps nowhere so more than in Virginia.\n\nThey literally can't win.",

In their garden of Eden the truth is the deadly apple, and Democrats are the serpent that is tempting them to eat of it. What we need is a kind of critical Bible theory that acknowledges faith and the transcendence of God, but also acknowledges science and the origins of the Bible. We will never get the South to accept simple realities like climate change or vaccines as long as evangelicals remain blinded by their idol worship of a medieval interpretation of a collection of various books assembled by politically motivated clerics 1500 years ago in Nicaea for the purpose of elevating the power of the emperor Constantine.  To read and understand any book, including the Bible or our county’s history, one must read it critically (which simply means thoughtfully). Anything else is just propaganda. Right wing propaganda, both religious as well as historical, is killing democracy and true faith both here and abroad. In this respect Virginia is becoming very much like Iran or other middle east “theocracies”.",

But you'd have to be living under a rock to avoid noticing how the conversations on race & gender (the other hotbutton social issue) have shifted rapidly in the past year, from our schools to our workplaces. This paradigm shift has been led by a very small group of elites who are completely out of sync with the way average people think about these issues, and whose only response to pushback has been something akin to \"your resistence is futile\" or worse yet, \"your resistence is proof that you were the white supremecist transphobe we knew you we knew you were all along\". \n\nSuch arrogance is occasionally punished. My remaining question is whether the Dems went along with all of this nonsense because they agree, or because they're too weak-willed to stand up for themselves?",

The issue isn't really today's curriculum as much as the Republican party puts that forward. The issue is the curriculum that the parents of today's students were exposed to. The issue is also the curriculum that their parents were taught. In my mind all that is ever different is the packaging. From Reagan's welfare queens to HW Bush and his Willie Horton ad it is always about race.  The great filmmaker Ken Burns in an interview said that the most surprising thing about researching his documentaries is that the question of race eventually came to the forefront. This plus the fact that your electoral system favours the Republicans makes me feel a real storm is headed your way. I feel nothing but sorrow and pity for a once great country.",

The shadow and spirit of Donald Trump will likely be with the Republicans next year, but they must not be allowed to dominate the party.

I would agree, however, that cultural progressives have made themselves vulnerable by championing works like *White Fragility.* The title alone should cause real liberals to balk. It’s not okay to make such sweeping negative stereotypes about any racial or ethnic group, even your own. Can you imagine a book called “Asian Fragility* which suggests Asian-Americans are too sensitive about popular stereotypes of them? Or a book called *Black Fragility* that suggests African-Americans are too sensitive about cops killing young Black men? Such books would be immediately and rightly condemned. But progressives have always had a hard time drawing distinctions between productive and unproductive arguments from those in their tribe. And they do so to their detriment.",

If I thought that was a true or helpful viewpoint, I would want it taught to my kids. But it is not true of helpful. It is simplistic, narrow, harmful to kids of all racial backgrounds. Plus, it does not help Black people who need improved education, housing, healthcare, job training, neighborhood safety, judicial representation, etc. CRT doesn’t bring about the end of the war on drugs, it doesn’t improve reading instruction in schools or address gun violence or do any of the concrete work that needs to be done. CRT just ladles out shame, fear, and self-censorship, and makes kids hyper-aware of race without giving them any tools to fight poverty.",

This reliance has been going on for over 50 years - it is not a result of the left's push to change the teaching of racial history in schools, much less CRT itself.  It is not something that Trump originated.  At this point almost anything can be made a rallying point for the right - real issues are not needed, just something that will touch off a racial reaction.  Or even totally fictitious or absurd things, such as the resistance to vaccination.\n\nThere has been no \"ideological revolution\" on the left, just an increasing emphasis on finally eliminating racism.  There are excesses, as there always are in politics and culture.  Meanwhile the Republican political right has basically abandoned appealing for or against any real ideology - it's now dependent on arousing racism and xenophobia.  If the left dropped the idea of revising school curricula Republicans would find some other way of doing this, as they have been doing for decades.",

Real people care about the real issues impacting them and the campaign messaging needs to reflect what lies within in the purview of the office being sought. Buying into the Fox 'news' view of the world is a mistake - for one side to solely believe that is reality and for Democrats to believe that is what the other side solely believes. I'm not sure the CRT issue is grass-roots driven as Mr. Douthat states; it has all the earmarks of a centrally developed and coordinated \"whip-up-the-masses\" program.

While it is obvious that there are voices of a few being repeated and amplified by social-media, few political leaders are actually listening to We-the-People.\n\nBoth parties suffer from the problem of loving to hear their own voice, telling everyone what they will do if/when elected. Both parties also suffer from critical thinking before speaking. Also, making promises that get them elected but they never plan to implement.\n\nWe-the-People are fickle, of the moment and not called to reflect or consider let alone tackle complex problems of being part of a nation of over 300M people in a nation awash in real problems.\n\nLastly, we have lost local news that covers the governance that has the greatest effect on our lives in favor of the national stage where diversion and misinformation abounds. That brings the polarization of national issues to the local level where those issues cannot be resolved while the real day-to-day issues are ignored.\n\nYes, our nation is in crisis, and there are forces that will break the nation apart if we allow it to happen.

There was a time when Democrats effectively dominated in the states, but abandoned this strategy and put all their chips on the presidential election, thus loosing their control over neighborhood/ward politics and the consistent voting patterns these local entities sustained (Republicans took up the mantle of dominating at the state level). Additionally, as a recent guest on Bill Maher’s show stated, Democrats have to stop running “political retreads” and bring to the forefront new blood that can bring passion to the ideas this nation needs to move forward. My god, Dianne Feinstein is 88, Nancy Pelosi is 81, Patrick Leahy is 81, Joe Biden is 78, etc. (the Clinton years are over). So, Democrats need a concerted effort to take back individual states, build a strong base of consistent voters on the local level (they cannot rely on whimsical voters during the presidential cycle), and develop young blood to enunciate new ideas and ideals.",

The reason Democrats lose, and keep losing, is because Democratic voters don't vote unless they are \"motivated\" and \"energized\" by an almost impossible candidate who reflects their own personal values. Republicans, on the other hand, seem to vote to have Republicans win and then do (or not do) things that Republicans value. Until Democratic voters wake up and realize that not voting because your candidate doesn't pass an ideological purity test means YOU ARE PUTTING A REPUBLICAN in office, not simply voicing your displeasure to your own party, this trend will continue. Not delivering on anything substantial 11 months after a national election doesn't help, either....",

Parents have NEVER dictated public school curricula.  McAuliffe was poor at countering this line of attack.\n\nAlso, McAuliffe, a conservative Democrat, was not in position to energize the Democratic base without the looming presence of a monster like Trump.\n\nThe topmost reason is the timing of Virginia elections.  Nine months after Joe Biden took the oath of office, one of the chief issues was that Democrats have not yet achieved the goals they were elected in 2020 to achieve.  Yet although there is no way for a president facing a Congress in which his party holds only the smallest majority could possibly achieve its goals in such a brief time in office.  So Biden, and through him Democrats in general, have been painted as a \"failure.\"\n\nThis election was NOT a rejection of Democratic policies, which most voters favor.  Despite the efforts of right-wing pundits to paint it as such, it was the reverse, a disappointment in the failure to implement the liberal agenda more rapidly than possible without Rooseveltian majorities in Congress.\n\nIt is actually misplaced blame for the effects of Republican obstruction that did us in.

If we, the current generation, acquiesce to  or benefit from injustice that results from the sins of previous generations, we too are responsible.  This is especially the case in a democratic republic where we, The People, are responsible for determining how it will work.  Jesus and the Prophets repeatedly called out the sins of individuals and societies. Systemic racism is real and it is a sin.  Wishing it would just go away does not work any better with it than other sins.  Who among US is truly innocent?  Anyone familiar with children knows they are not innocent, they can be and frequently do act cruelly.  That is why they must be educated and socialized by parents and society.  We may be forgiven, but that does not make US innocent rather redeemed. The final question of the Baptismal Covenant in the Episcopal order of Baptism asks: \"Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?\"",

However, like many people need a morning cup of coffee to start their day off right, Republicans need a constant stream of fantastical demons to assault in order for them to buttress the \"violent protector\" identity they so value.   They need to keep going their self-reinforcing delusions that there are hordes of politicians who seek to:  steal their guns, deface their Bibles, force them into mental reeducation camps, teach their children communist doctrines, make them drive electric cars, invade their churches.  Many of them (like Trump) grew up in \"strict father\" families where the patriarch ruled by threat of violence, and this psychological dynamic serves as an umbrella paradigm over everything -- either you must dominate everyone, or you will be dominated.  \n\nWithin this framework Congressional Democrats, as a whole, are inept at turning out their voters.  They let Trumper Republicans assault them in their place of work (the capitol) and are well on their way to Stockholm Syndrome.  On January 7th, the unified message should have been:  \"The Republican party has become a party of treasonous insurrection, but instead we got 'meh,' and you can see what that got us.",

My wife, who has never been politically active on any issue, started marching in the streets. I am a professional historian and she's always relied on political analysis from me. Now she was the one recommending books. Yes, there was an ideological shift. It seemed--with people lime Mitt Romney marching in the streets with BLM protesters--that we were finally going to have a long national conversation about race. At long last. And the backlash on the right, which has taken the form of anti-CRT rhetoric, has become a movement to deny the very possibility of that conversation. This has taken the form of protest over what is taught in school because it is, squarely, about our national past, and present.",

Though racism went underground after the civil rights act, it did not disappear.  One could argue that the Republican party relies on it to turn out its voters and suppress others.\nStudents should learn some of that history and learn from it.  Parents who do not want children to learn the real history of their Commonwealth and nation and attack school officials for teaching it or insisting on basic good health measures, are not looking out for the real interests of their children.  Yongkin used exaggerations, lies, and a lot of logically fallacious innuendo in his well funded but essentially vacuous  campaign.   Virginians will have to learn the hard way who Glen Yongkin really is and let's hope it is the relatively benign businessman portrayed in many of his image ads, and not the despicable liar and character assassin who believed in voter fraud and Donald Trump.",

We've had Kendi come and do an optional presentation to the entire company.\n\nThis, in a company that's probably 40% immigrants from Asia, who came and stay here because they obviously don't believe that the company is a hotbed of white supremacy.  A company whose CEO, for that matter, is actually an immigrant from India.\n\nDemocrats need a simple theme.  That theme should be \"making capitalism work for working people.\"  That means the CEO and his staff shouldn't walk away with 10% of the company's profits.  That workers can't be on call every day, and then only paid for those hours they're called.  That health care should be affordable for the middle class, not just people who are rich or on Medicaid.  That means affordable state colleges.  That means that a drug's development is paid for by the US, the drug must be sold for a fair, not outrageous, profit.\n\nC'mon folks, finding economic unfairness in the US isn't that hard.",

Of course not.

I am pretty certain that a sizable number of the parents of schoolchildren in Virginia were subject to similar (identical?) workshops and seminars in their own workplaces. \n\nPerhaps like my wife, an Asian woman who has been on the receiving end of various micro- and macro-aggressions, they were asked to sign a pledge attesting to their 'privilege' and promising to do better. You know, read up on the history of racism on the weekends (I'm not making that up) \n\nSo why would the citizens of Virginia doubt for a moment that their children might also be subject to the same sort of treatment, and side with the candidate who stands against it?",

I think liberals are frustrated over Trump's ascendance and the right's intransigence on cultural issues like race.  It's just pushing people farther apart and to the edges.",

Are they simply incompetent or are they torn in serving their Wall Street masters? I don't care any more. I am sick of minority extremes on either side driving issues.

While Ross Douthat likely does not care since he would rather pound the worn point regarding hysteria about racecraft or woke culture or cancel culture or whatever the term of the day is that exaggerates the \"scary\" scholarship of the left that centralizes race in the context of American history and cultural activities.  More people, I am sure, have read The Warmth of Other Suns and Caste than have read anything by Ibram Kendi, but what does it matter?  These are works that are part of the current discussion, not an effort to indoctrinate anyone.  \n\nI await the analysis regarding voter turnout in Virginia or New Jersey yesterday.  My intuition is that voters who deeply desire the passage of Biden's aggressive agenda regarding social infrastructure and family support, legislation that has been deflated and dissected by Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, did not show up.  Those who believe in the rule of law and have not seen Trump, Giuliani, Powell, Eastman, Brooks, Gosar, Bannon or any other leaders of the insurrection pay a price for their lawlessness stayed home.  Those who see states passing voting suppression and election invalidation laws without a response from Congress to protect the sanctity of elections decided not to vote yesterday.",

To something catchy like: let's have order in the classroom and proficiency in math and English. -- rather than wokeness and endless lectures on how bad those white students are.\n\nOf course, the Dems won't, and can't.  In fear of being primaried for being not-woke-enough (or, worse, being called racist) and completely beholden to the somewhat slow-witted leaders of the teachers unions,  the Dems will, in 2022, rush once again to man the woke/progresive battlements.

What qualifies them to set a curriculum?  In truth, they want to keep their children in the dark about a horrendous past.\n\nSo what should we teach children about slavery? about segregation? How about the truth.  How many slaves were there? how central was slavery to our economic development? In Virginia children should be told that upwards of 40% of the population of the State were slaves, that Virginia was a breeding ground for slaves that were then sold down the river to be worked to death in forced labor camps.  That Thomas Jefferson, when he was in his mid 40s began a sexual relationship with a 15 year old slave girl he owned who was half sister to his dead wife and so aunt to her daughter, that the relationship can in no way be called consensual.  That that statute to Robert E. Lee is being brought down because he was a brutal slave owner who led an insurrection against the country to preserve slavery, that when he invaded Pennsylvania he kidnapped free Blacks and sold them south into slavery.  \n\nHow about truth telling.",

And it is hardly surprising that the first reaction of many is denial. Who wants to admit that the race is rigged, that their accomplishments are not entirely their own? Who wants to admit that their political system has been responsible for so much evil? As a country, we are in a (very) long running  process of shedding our childish notions and facing the truth. We must do this if we are ever going to realize the American ideals we claim to cherish. In your piece last week, you admitted that before you yourself had Lyme disease, you doubted the reports of people suffering from Lyme and other long-term debilitating diseases. Now you have experienced the injustice and terrible harm done by denying another person's pain and suffering.  Apply that lesson to race in America. Then redirect your energy, talent and your platform to illuminating these injustices and terrible harms. Help move Americans move through all of the stages of grief over our tragic history so that we can become what we always hoped we were.",

Schools are supposed to stretch minds, not coddle them to keep them in narrow comfort zones.  But that is what the Republican elites want, a further dumbed down population they can easily manipulate.  He should have pointed out how unworkable parental control over curriculum could become if followed to that logical conclusion.\n\nTeaching or sensitizing white children, in an age appropriate way, that the child with different colored skin sitting in the desk next to them probably won’t enjoy the same educational opportunities later on, or won’t be treated the same way by a police officer, or won’t be able to get an affordable mortgage because the area they live in has been redlined, are necessary steps in building some cross cultural, ethnic empathy.\n\nSadly that enough suburbanites bought into Youngkin’s lie about CRT being taught in schools, may negate Biden’s core assumption about America today. “This is not who we are”.  Sadly,  This is who we are.",

Any discussion of his defeat that leaves that fact out of the equation is going to be worthless.\n\nDouthat is not wrong in noting that Youngkin was able to exploit widespread anxieties about cultural shifts in how some institutions have been taking about racism since the nation-wide rebellion that followed the police murder of George Floyd.\n\nBut McCauliffe's defeat was not so much the result of anything he had to say about Toni Morrison as it was about his inability to plausibly represent an alternative to Youngkin on the issues that turn out poor and working class voters.\n\nThe Democratic Party remains under the domination not of its progressive wing, but of its corporate centrist wing. It is the corporate centrists, not the progressives, who stand for giving people racial sensitivity trainings INSTEAD of raising the minimum wage, delivering Medicare for All, and making it easier for workers to form and join unions.\n\nPeople have lots of good reasons to be anxious about their own circumstances and those of the world. When neither party seriously addresses the most serious ones because they have both been captured not by some amorphous \"cultural elite\" but by banks, hedge funds, and corporations and the multimillionaires (like Youngkin AND McCaulliffe) who own them, some become vulnerable to racial demagoguery that shifts the focus of their anxieties as Youngkin did.",

Or are they being taught alongside conservative theories that critique cultural and social behavior as possible forces that also explain the disparities? I'm assuming it's often the former which is problematic. The left and believers in CRT and systemic racism seem certain they are correct as do those on the right who believe solely in personal responsibility. Ideally both these possible explanations could be explained well to young people who could decide if they feel strongly one way or the other or would perhaps synthesize the arguments. The questions around individual agency as it relates to larger social and legal systems are incredibly complex and philosophical. I'm surprised how many people now think the answers to the questions that arise are obvious.",

Candidates lose elections when they deny what drives voters to both the polls and usually-sleepy school board meetings.

Civil Rights and race dominate school curricula in state after state -- civil rights in particular is the new master narrative that you can find in high school textbooks and college intro courses, as well as 6-9th grade social studies.  Parents aren't angry about that, they're angry when race is redefined and then inserted into an existing curriculum, in ways that defy common sense, the ideal of a color-blind society, and the belief that the way to end discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.",

If the GOP leaders are carrying on about CRT and a parent wants to know what that is, they can search it and learn for themselves. However, what they will learn will not be what is being taught in schools. It is in the GOP playbook to take a bit of truth and turn it into something it is not and get everyone riled up. Parents are certainly able to find out what exactly is being taught in their districts. But what we see is them responding at school board meetings to something that is not true. All of us should be worried about that.",

Manchin wants Zero investment in social capital because that means that his family’s wealth form coal and pharmaceutical interests will be taxed higher.  Manchin will never support the bills.  Even if he does, he will only do so by the time it is too late to make a difference to the ‘22 elections.\nBiden needs to summon his inner LBJ and tell Manchin that he either supports the BBB bill or Zero dollars from infrastructure will be spent in WVA.",

Thus, they try to downplay the role of racial politics as a factor in the campaign. Others, like Ross, want to embrace the centrality of racial politics as being at the heart of Youngkin's win, contending that it is the fruits of progressive overreach.  I guess I'm a little reluctant to accept any such definitive pronouncements the day after a close election, but I'm also not a New York Time pundit.  Rather, just an informed citizen, and a committed Democrat trying to figure all this out. So I'm going to withhold my judgments until I can gather and digest the flood of data and serious analysis that is no doubt on its way.",

If I myself were to draw a conclusion, it's that voter apathy is alive and well, with only 2/3s as many Virginians voting in 2021 as in 2020.  When you factor in the eligible voters who never vote in Virginia, the number of nonvoters vs. voters in Virginia in 2020 differed little.\n\nThe Republican playbook was simple:  don't mention Trump's name; decry an educational theory that isn't actually being implemented in the state; stand for \"good jobs\"; have your undeniably elitist candidate for governor dress down and surround himself with reminders that he's a \"family man\" and \"religious\"; and say nothing -- absolutely nothing -- that can dissected as a controversial position.  Believe those positions all you want, Mr. Youngkin; just don't say them aloud until the voting is done.\n\nIn many ways, the Democrats' strategy was quite similar to their approach to the 2020 presidential election:  bank on an establishment warhorse who seems unobjectionable -- albeit, unexciting -- to an undecided voter.  Of course, that meant ignoring Virginia's history of only having re-elected a term-limited governor in a subsequent contest once.  Once.\n\nOn the up side for Democrats, no one will have to listen endlessly to Republican accusations of voter fraud affecting the outcome.",

If last night is a trend, then we are doomed in the mid-term next year. The suburban Republicans that despised Trump and voted for Biden in 2020 are going back to their team because team Biden does not align with their political ideology.  Well if the trend continues, it won't align with my ideology either.   The results from last night not just in Virginia or NJ but the local school board elections should be a wake up call for the \"real Democrats\", not the far left keyboard warriors. Having million followers on FB, Instagram and Twitter does not translate to the number of votes.\n\nThe infighting between the squad and the moderate Democrat has led to this massive failure. Most people who are in the center like myself do not want the Government to spend trillions of dollars in the name of social programs. We want good roads and bridges but we do not want to hand out money to people choosing to have multiple children and expecting the Government to pay, we do not want to pay off student loan debts when students make bad financial decisions and incur thousands of dollars in student loan for a degree that pays them $30K . This handing out of money needs to stop if Democrats want to see any victory moving forward because honestly, we are doomed.",

Biden won Maine but Susan Collins won by six points there, and there are myriad examples like that.\n\nIt's really not that surprising.

The problem is presentism-- applying the values of the present, totally out of context,  to morally judge the past.  That is what is wrong with CRT-type ideas (which CAN be taught in watered-down fashion to children).  This approach is done deliberately to keep minorities from facing hard and humiliating truths.  Back in the 1700s there was no multiculturalism.  When Europeans looked at Africans they did not assume that they were somehow the same as Europeans \"under the skin.\"  What would that possibly mean? \n There was no abstract concept of \"the human race.\"  To say an uneducated west African tribesman was somehow \"the equal\" of an educated \"cultured\" European would have seemed bizarre.  Equal?  How? Where exactly was this abstract \"equality?\"  Africans lived very different lives and exploited each other (their extensive system of slavery) and were happy to sell slaves to Europeans.  Europeans did not enslave each other, but were quite happy adapting the African custom with Africans.  Let's not pretend that people of the past thought just like us, only with less morals.  The past deserves better than that.",

It's about getting children to feel the way you, as an individual, want (and what parent put you in charge of their kid's feelings?).  But kids are pretty good at figuring out when an adult has an \"agenda\" like that.  The 20th century had Russian and Chinese \"re-education camps\" for wrong-feeling folk, and I'm sure you don't want to be in that company.   It is hard to teach history in its proper context.  From your comment it's clear you think that Europeans of the 1700s \"should have known better\" (\"morally wrong\")  But that's just your inability to imagine people who don't think the way you, in the 21st century, think.",

The progressives have made big concessions throughout this process $6T to $3.5 T to $1.75T and still Manchin and Sinema tease and move the goal posts. Manchin is now posturing that a deal could be had by Thanksgiving.  He is just running out the clock.  Anyone who thinks he has any integrity is deluding themselves.",

Similarly Dems have committed the mother of all unforced errors with their Congressional log jam on something called reconciliation, all the while voters are truly noticing inflation, especially at the pump.

I would add that in addition to issues of race & equity, Democrats have also yielded considerable political capital by their inflexibility and alienating moralizations on COVID. The common theme is that the big-tent of the Democratic Party is embracing an oxymoronic dogmatism of tolerance that is intolerant to anyone speaking a different language than the jargon from scholars or coming from a different perspective. This isn’t surprising given the left organizing itself around the academy, which has become something of a think tank for liberalism that, due to the extreme political biases in its faculty, is not tolerant of conservative views, nuance, and other moderating forces.\n\nThe root problem of the Democratic Party is that it claims to push policies that help the working class and downtrodden, but it does so through an alliance with and appropriation of concepts from an academic elite that is disconnected from and snobbish towards the working class and downtrodden. Elitism in a left-dominated academia trickles down to snobbery and disdain for the views of high school educated, well-meaning people who, for example, might have preferred to get COVID than lose their job & home.\n\nI say all this as a moderate who left the academy after political microaggressions from pre-COVID  transformer to hostility during COVID - the left tolerates intolerance towards non-progressive proposals, views, and even inconvenient science.",

I was rewarded with teaching and research awards until I refused to engage in PC politics and grade inflation. I believed I was hired to transmit the findings of my discipline to students. When it became clear I did not believe we should in anyway share our political views with students and that on campus and system faculty committees I had voted against rewards or promotions to fellow faculty I became very unpopular. I voted against a maximum raise for one individual who claimed 9 articles in their yearly evaluation but when I looked them up, they were one page blogs. My committee colleagues didn't brother to check. Another person got tenure with one book and two referred articles. The book was awful, and the two articles were verbatim self-plagiarized chapters from the book. Again, my colleagues did not check. The blogger and self-plagiarizer got raises and a promotion to tenure. My vote against them was leaked and both complained about me. I quit serving on such committees. I remain a left wing liberal but realize how those views can be destructive and forced onto students and non-liberal faculty. Faculty are hired to teach, not advocate their political views. Despite my liberal core, the University became a hostile work place and I left.",

They're upset that their kids are being taught to think about other races differently than they were taught.  \n\nThe people who feel this way have to be given a reason to see it as a better path forward than hiding history.

Youngkin won because of white backlash, and he counted on the white voters whose parents and grandparents shut down public education in Virginia rather than integrate.  The right's objection to CRT is exactly like the objection to integration following Brown.  Whites fear CRT will destroy their social, economic and political status, just as they feared integration would do the same.  Objection to CRT is racist dog whistle, and it motivates racial fears just as miscegenation did 60 years ago.",

Obama backlash, Trump election, CRT fear-mongering, anti-immigrant sentiment, pro open carry laws, pro-civil war politicians and militias, pro confederate statue backlash, anti-vax and anti-abortion laws all have same root cause:  white people--particularly white men--are dwindling in numbers and losing control.  That's it. \n\nWe're going to continue to experience discord, rebellion, hate, and fear until the dust settles on our country's demographics and people change the definition of \"white\" as we have through the decades (remember, Italians weren't considered white in the 1800s).   Like \"White Flight\" to the suburbs in the 60s and 70s, this is 'White Fright\" about the changing country.  Nothing more. Nothing less.",

He had radio ads, billboards, and used fear mongering with CRT and Trans issues in schools to generate a base. McAuliffe barely showed up. I didn't get emails, never heard radio ads, and he did not have a strong enough message to get people fired up about him being governor again. His entire schtick was \"I was Governor before and I'm a democrat so vote for me\". \n\nIf Democrats want to get out of this slump and generate the momentum needed for the next election cycle they will need a unified message stating their goals and how they will accomplish them, as well as tons of public outreach. McAuliffe botched this campaign, hopefully democrats will learn from his mistakes.",

This intellectual spasm is historically simplistic and politically suicidal. NOBODY, of any group, wants to be told they are \"fragile\" and guilt-laden. Sure, it plays well with some college sophomores. But the American voter is not a college sophomore.

It is not logical that American workers do not enjoy the same social guarantees as their European counterparts, in the fields of education, health, vacations, etc. This puts them at a disadvantage, and negatively affects the quality of our competition in all business activities.\nIt would be a great blessing if our leaders would try to emulate our President Joe Biden, who courageously gives his all to save this country.",

It's based on images and reports that condemn any call to control illegal immigration as racism, topped by this week's report that illegals and their children who were separated at the border (as per court orders) will be awarded 5 to 10 times the average American's entire net worth.\n\nIn a few years we will be a majority BIPOC country. The transition will be a LOT easier if the soon to be majority softens the hostility of its rhetoric. In the meantime I don't expect Democrats to be very competitive among whites with less than a few million bucks in their stock portfolios.",

And his socialist agenda today -- blocking the infrastructure vote while he blindly pushes forward a bill the majority does not want, along with a highly specious method of funding (funding is anathema to Sander's platforms) -- puts him squarely responsible for the pot of hot oil the Democrats find themselves in after last night's vote. This guy has to be sidelined. He is scripting the path for a Trump/GOP comeback right before our eyes. How much damage to the party, to the Republic, will we allow this sourpuss senator -- a man who has never accomplished anything in 25 years as an elected official -- to achieve? Biden better grow some, Pelosi, Schumer and Harris need to join forces and shut down this ultra left movement -- or we can count on 4 more years of pain and suffering commencing in 2024.",

So you want all the money to go to you and not to the kids which is different than when you were young. \n\nThose special plans for special people often help kids become productive citizens. (I've never seen a single kid have 5 people \"dance attendance on them\". At most one. For kids with severe disabilities. When they are young. And who would otherwise disrupt the class. ) Early intervention programs for kids with difficulties saves money. I know my son, now in college and #11 in his class in high school, used it for language. It is why he will be self-sustaining and not a drain on society.",

                "commentBody": "Ross Douthat writes about America’s discomfort with its racist past. Well, that’s undoubtedly true. We don’t have Lost Cause post-Civil War denialism for nothing, or the mythology about the superiority of Whites over Native Americans or the Battle of the Alamo, the unworthiness of Chinese immigrants in the 1800’s or the danger posed in WWII by Japanese-Americans. But the real problem is that these beliefs are still here about those issues and about current ones like Spanish-speaking immigrants or Muslims. \n\nMaybe all countries have national mythologies and maybe their dominant social groups are “uncomfortable” with challenges to their beliefs about their roots and their superiority. This road has been trod around the world in the past and continues to be today. But it has been and is being weaponized in far too many places to create horrific national tragedies. I’ve hard it said that the first casualty of war is the truth and that is certainly true in culture wars. \n\nFor me, of all the ugliness of the Trump years, the denial of truth and the attacks on honesty and personal integrity are the most frightening. That is the lesson I draw from the vote in Virginia. If this is “the roadmap for Republican victory” in 2022 and 2024 and beyond, God help us, because we are certainly proving to be incapable of helping ourselves. It is not at all apparent that American democracy will be able to protect itself from misinformation, disinformation and intentional ignorance.",

                "commentBody": "I appreciate Douthat stating that CRT is an \"imperfect term\" for the dissatisfaction Virginia parents have felt in their schools. The erosion of merit, in name of equity, is another contentious issue felt in my community. For example: changing the admissions process for Governor's Schools to de-emphasize academic preparedness and pending plans to revamp math curriculum away from Algebra, Geometry to some vague \"Fundamentals of Mathematics\" through 11th grade. These changes are being made to obscure or limit the ability for high-achieving students to excel, so that others don't feel left behind. Instead the Commonwealth could triple-down on providing academic assistance to students at risk instead of lowering the bar. It's wrong for our country, future scientists, and engineers to lower academic standards and opportunity to handicap a highly-successful minority group in order to advantage another minority group(s). Virginia parent dissatisfaction with the educational changes is not as simple \"anti-CRT\" as is described in many articles.",

He tried to run against Trump ( not on the ballot) and then told parents they should have no say in their children's education. Youngkin is a family man private equity guy. He is not Trump. Frankly, he is more like Romney. Democrats can't hide their poor performance in DC by bashing Trump. Second, Wokism will lose moderates and independents from the democratic party. last night commentators on MSNBC railed how CRT isn't real and this is dangerous. On fox they interviewed a soccer mom from northern Virginia who said,\" I usually always vote democrat but when you start indoctrinating my kid all bets are off.\" Then she pulls out a first grade reading pamphlet her child brought home from school  entitled Woke Baby.  Progressive wokism is a loser for democrats if they want to stay in office.",

Trust me, the New Jersey vote isn't all about property taxes.\n\nIt wouldn't have mattered if Democrats pointed at programs they passed, or how they handled the Covid pandemic or relief checks. Even Biden's $1.5 trillion Build Back Better bill is viewed suspiciously by whites, especially the social safety net part, as just more free stuff for people who don't apply themselves.\n\nSadly, in my long lifetime, Black Americans seem to be at perhaps their most precarious point. And even more ominously Republicans are picking up significant Asian and Hispanic votes.",

I'm going to blame Manchin, Sinema, McConnell, ALEC, the various Koch organizations, and the Citizens United decision.

The nearly senseless, directionless infighting within the Democratic caucus has created a magnificent opportunity for the Republicans to exploit.  The racial themes were just the galvanizing thrust that got the \"own the libs\" crowd motivated.  Without any real policy victories to run on, the campaign devolved into cultural issues.  Trump proved how powerful those are.\n\nToni Morrison's books have been around for decades.  All of the sudden, they are now the problem for Democrats.  Again, lack of progress and unity has allowed Beloved to become the field to die on.\n\nWhat happens at the upper echelons of academia isn't motivating voters.  Racial identity does.  Economic opportunity does.  Feelings of self-empowerment does.  Fear of losing control does.  The Democrats have not provided any feelings of security concerning these issues.\n\nPeople now want results now, not spread out over years.  With the Democrats promising all and delivering nothing, they have created the impression of feckless incompetence.  Biden looks weak and ineffective.  We now have president Sinema, president Manchin, president Jayapal.  The people did not elect them president.  They elected Biden.  The backlash has begun.  The three defacto co-presidents need to wake up before Beloved becomes 2024's defeat.",

Judging by the comments in this section and elsewhere, the initial Democratic take on last nights results is to double down on the current Progressive gestalt.  This is a recipe for disaster and the Democrats are going to get completely trounced in 2022.  With respect to the current policy initiatives, the Build Back Better bill is dead.  If the Democrats were smart, they would hold an immediate vote on the Infrastructure Bill and force the Progressives to tow the line.  This of course will not happen.  The game is over.

All of the sudden, they are now the problem for Democrats.\"  This kind of absurd  strawman is what gets Democrats in trouble.  *This* is what suburban voters voted against, which appears on the official Virginia Department of Education site:\"White Supremacy: the idea (ideology) that white people and the ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions of white people are superior to people of color and their ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions. While most people associate white supremacy with extremist groups, white supremacy is ever present in our institutional and cultural assumptions that assign value, morality, goodness, and humanity to the white group while casting people and communities of color as worthless (worth less), immoral, bad, and inhuman and “undeserving.” Drawing from critical race theory, the term “white supremacy” also refers to a political or socio-economic system where white people enjoy structural advantage and rights that other racial and ethnic groups do not, both at a collective and an individual level.\"  <a href=\"https://www.virginiaisforlearners.virginia.gov/anti-racism-in-education\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.virginiaisforlearners.virginia.gov/anti-racism-in-education</a>/",

This constituency is losing real political power and within the next 10 years will fall into complete irrelevance in the blue and even purple states as young people vote more and more Democrat.  In the short run the anti-voter State laws enacting disenfranchisement will have some effect, but ultimately, Republicans will lose the demographic game.  At that point they will continue to try to foment a civil war in the same way that rich slaveholders in the South created a Civil War based on \"culture issues\" and \"State's rights\" in order to enlist their non-slaveholding neighbors into risking life and limb in order to protect the economic advantages of slaveholding.",

Biden has a Pandemic to deal with an unreliable supply chain in the face of altered and unpredictable conditions and resultant economic damage.      \nWhile Senators Manchin and Sinema have undercut some of the rest of their party in an enigmatic quest for independence, they have threatened their entire party as well as their own possible benefit from some party identification.    One wonders what point they have in remaining Dems if they only alienate many of their peers and yet remain free of the GOP.   'President Jayapal' is more insistent than anything else.    She has hectored Biden, but has conceded time and time again to changes and is more defensive than obstructing in her protests.   I would not group her with Manchin or Sinema to nearly the same extent as much of her positions have been those claimed by Biden himself.\nBiden would do well to have the force of LBJ in office, but he has no opposition support and has little power to budge the reluctant members of a somewhat split party.    \nThe GOP has a simple business to destroy the current administration.    It is when they gain power that they have a problem.    Unlike Biden, Trump was not called feckless when he did nothing to fight the Pandemic or replace Obama's programs.",

The Biden administration started out strong. But infighting amongst Congress has stalled his agenda. There's plenty of blame to go around on that. Neither the progressives or moderates are guilt free.\n\nMoreover, Republicans have been great at extending the pandemic in order to hurt Biden politically, while also creating racial wedge issues. They did the same with Obama, doing their best to extend the Great Recession while using the presence of a Black president to gin up White racism.\n\nBut recent events reveal two things:\n\n1. It shows Democrats that if they don't get things done, they'll lose dramatically next year. Maybe this will spark them to get their act together\n\n2. It shows Republicans that they do better without Trump. 2017-2020 were debacles for them. Without Trump as a real factor, they're better off. Hopefully that lesson makes an imprint on them.",

They lied us into a war of trillions. I admire Biden for ending the 300-million-a-day, 3 trillion-dollar Afghanistan fiasco. Much pullout mess can be laid at the feet of the military and the Afghan government. The Vietnam pullout was infinitely worse. \n\nAmnesia, big yes.

One of them does so probably out of sincerely-felt differences (with a heavy dose of personal avarice thrown in...). The other one is just a foolish flake, probably driven more by personal greed, for both money and attention, than any real reasoning.\n\nRepublicans, by contrast, are utterly opposed to everything; a solid block - held either by ideological fervor, or political fear - held in thrall to Trump, in lockstep with his agenda and all, without deviance, in full opposition to achieving -anything- if Democrats get a share of the credit for it from the public.\n\nTaken together, \"nothing gets done\". This is exactly as Republicans would have it -- they don't care much for anything but directing ever more wealth to the already wealthy few anyway. What is the one signal achievement of Trump's administration? Trump's \"Tax Reform\" that directed more wealthy to the already wealthy. Republicans have apparently prospered by lying about it to the masses of voters the Democrats are actually trying to help. I wonder how long before people who voted for Youngkin realize they are getting nothing from him but lies?\n\nAs a recipe for dysfunctional governance, you couldn't do much more without actually rioting in the halls of Congress.

The strategy of projecting your vice onto your enemy so that it is easier to excuse your eventual misbehavior is happening in education. CRT never was the issue, it was about mobilizing grievance in ways that are fundamentally anti-learning and anti-education. So while Ross wants democrats to distance themselves from antiracist education, continued attention in this direction makes it far easier to miseducate students in states that are so \"concerned with indoctrination\" that they will start banning books and limiting access to anything that doesn't toe their party line. These elections are about the fact that our economy is in a bad place, inflation is high, energy is going to cost a ton this winter, and this just fuels the grievance-machine instead of most positive solution-oriented thinking.",

That is, it’s not just white racists who don’t want their children to learn about history. I’m an Independent, and an Afro American who lives in VA. And I’ve sat in meetings listening to people trying to implement racist ideas in schools in the name of anti racism. And, many people have been doing so, all across the nation, with a religious, uncompromising zeal. Good intentions do not necessarily produce good results. \n\nThe main person pushing back against these DEI policies in Virginia is a liberal, immigrant Muslim. My friends who live across the nation have listened to school board members trying to implement, for example, non- discipline rules for black kids because talking loud and interrupting is part of their culture!; Oregon changing Math because it’s racist, and all of these friends are Ds.\n\nJust because most news sources do not report about these things and choose to report only the authoritarians on the other side, does not mean there’s no problem.

The issue with teaching racial history in our schools is the way that the CRT grievance industry conducts the process and manipulates the messaging.  We have read the course descriptions.  We have read the first chapter of the 1619 project.  We have witnessed non-believers hounded and attacked on campus.  We have witnessed the absurdity of \"defund the police.\"\n\nThis loss is not about messaging.\n\nThis loss is all about a rejection of the woke folk Big Lie which is every bit as onerous as the Trump big lie.  (not a false equivalency as Trump's big lie is worse in that it threatens the basis of a democracy while the woke folk big lie merely insults our intelligence with the threat of extortion.)",

Fox News local ran that on an endless loop.\nInstead of clearing up the distinction of violent and non-violent protest, the City Council decided to cut a significant amount from the Police budget (amount has been debated). That was immediately labeled (note my inverted commas) 'Defund the Police' and featured in the last weeks of the Presidential campaign in all the House GOP candidates TV advts.even though the Federal House has no part in such decisions. And it worked.\nMaybe even further afield: the Texas Monthly (October issue) had a long analytic essay on why 2020 played so badly for Biden in the Rio Grande Valley.

As @LDurk articulates above, they know that the forces of antiracism have taken over schools. In this climate, when democrats want to teach accurate history, and this means talking about race (not telling people what they must think), that will be enough to alienate a portion of the electorate and fuel misinformation machines. But there has to be another story that can be told that also appeals to parents and communities. And--you are right--democrats aren't telling that story.  As a parent of four young children, I am worried about a world where they won't be able to work together with their neighbors to avert the worst outcomes of climate change. I don't know if that one is a winner in terms of messaging, but that is what I worry about.",

But that most people are just objecting to the infusion of race into every subject, and the naming of racism as the cause for every social ill. \n\nFinally, he suggests that if you believe that everything should be viewed through the lens of race, and that social justice should be front and center in schools, then stand up and fight for that. Just stop saying the movement doesn't exist. \n\nIt's all pretty reasonable and even handed. Meanwhile, the comments are basically, \"you can't handle the truth of our original sin!\".",

I am one of the Latinos that you have been wondering about.  Why are Latinos voting against the Democrats?  Because Democrats have embraced a new form of racism.",

Republican party almost fully supported by these rich folks led the way. But powerful Dem leaders and administrations also embraced it. They all protected and promoted the interest of corporate America and added fuel to religious/racial segregation while giving regular lip service to diversity & inclusion.\n\nThe decay we see in our politics, declining trust on Govt and politicians (with inevitable growing influence of religion and all sorts of conspiracy theories), decline of our economy for the middle class, worsening industrial competitiveness, rise of China and other serious competitors were some of its consequences.\n\nLet's see if the progressive Democrats can reform the party, defeat corporate lobbyists, white supremacists, and other such light-Red Dems within the party, and expose Republican hypocrisy to the working class Americans. It'll take time but it's also inevitable as American demography, geopolitical power, and prosperity is declining fast.",

If you use more than two syllables, logic, or, dare I say, scientific reasoning, you're \"one of the elite\" and you may just as well pontificate to the ocean or a brick wall. Unless the left is willing to stoop to the language of the right (propaganda, wild-eyed conspiracy theories, simplistic black and white thinking, guns, God, irrationality, pseudo-science (or better yet, no science), and outright lies), the battle is lost before it begins. And the left-wing frankly are too often spineless and petrified that they might say something that will offend someone somewhere. How many Democrats were cowed into voting for the disastrous Iraq War by the \"patriots\" argument from the semi-literate, know-nothing President at that time? How many overtly backed President Obama's healthcare initiatives during the midterms that followed? (Most Democrats didn't even want to be seen with Obama at that time.)",

This is something stemming from establishment Democrats, who would rather focus on calling people racists and xenophobes than dare talk of raising taxes or helping working class folks. \n\nThe strategy of being woke and \"not being Trump\" is an absolute failure embraced by the Clintonian-moderate-neoliberal wing of the party.

Dems want to function within the confines of democracy, win or lose. Republicans think democracy only works when they win, and are perfectly willing to tear the system down to gain or retain power.\n\nNow onto Virginia: yes, McAuliffe scored a massive own goal on the education question. Yes, the Dems in Virginia have delivered on their campaign promises on reforming voting, criminal justice (including pot and the death penalty), etc. Yes, this was an off-year election that typically energizes the party not in power. \n\nBut CRT is only an issue in the minds of those who harbor racial anxiety. That those people preferred to \"express\" their racial anxiety by latching on wokeism (whatever that is) and CRT (that's not taught in any Virginia grade schools) says more about where we are as a nation. That Fox News can create an issue out of thin air (CRT), and with a singular focus, make that the core issue of a national conversation, is emblematic of just how little the left media ecosystem is undermatched against the rightwing media ecosystem.",

Never once did a parent challenge me or my school on curriculum matters.  They trusted that we educators were professional and knew what we were doing. We had parents nights and parent teacher conferences if parents had and questions or concerns.  Now people are screaming at each other at school board meetings. And perhaps teachers these days aren’t as well equipped to deal  due to chronic low pay and low esteem by the public.  Can you imagine the chaos if all parents had a say in the entire curriculum and how many different opinions and views a teachers would have to contend with? \n\nUnfortunately, this issue is just another example of the deep polarization and misinformation that we are collectively experiencing today. These parents depend on their schools and teachers, yet they really feel that they know how and what to teach?  The more Virginia creates dissent and distrust, the worse their school system will become.",

They find ways to win.\n\nEventually, just as people in other places vote in theocrats, who then destroy the democracy, Americans too have a right to vote in favor of a crime syndicate that will usher in a stern theocracy and a strict capitalist state for everyone but themselves (they will have everything free for themselves on the labor of others).\n\nI commend republicans.  OF course you should win; the democrats have zero reliable constituencies, and therefore they and their constituencies should suffer the consequences.  If they cared about what happened to them, or their country, they would have come out to vote.  They didn't.\n\nGo ahead, unleash your vision.

What Youngkin's educational theorizing  amounts to is an intense effort to threaten white people with the idea that there is a more honest and equitable way to understand  the history of race relations in America than what has been the national tradition. Does anyone really think that groups of people are called \"minorities\" because they are viewed as equal to the \"majority\" members of society? The issue with C.R.T. is that it presents the possibility that being in the presumed majority might not entitle lucky citizens to advantages and opportunities that are not equally accorded to the rest of the population. The premise that panicky white parents are entitled to restrict exposure to ideas that do not reinforce their exclusive belief system is outrageous. And the reality that white voters and Douthat himself are so open to being close-minded is chilling. Absolute garbage.",

Ideas, especially radical ones, scare them because they’re told to be scared of them. The GOP ad featuring the coded racist message about Toni Morrison’s book says it all: Fear knowledge. Fear difference. Fear great literature. How else can they control people unless they convince them that learning is bad? As for Democrats, they’re hapless at demagoguery and they have no swagger. Their ideas are right; they just don’t know how to communicate them to people who don’t read.",

First, Biden's performance did impact the race for sure, but even bigger is running a political hack like Terry McAuliffe, who was past his expiration date. You might as well had Hillary Clinton move to the state and run. Second, even though Trumpists and Murdochnistas weighed in and acted like cheerleaders for Youngkin, I seriously doubt that they had much influence in the outcome. Youngkin likely would have been elected anyway. Last, Republicans and Democrats can win without needing to cater to their screwy fringes if they avoid promoting the candidacy of anyone whose major attribute is carrying water for their party or someone who enthuses 15% of and alienates the rest of their party and  simultaneously making independents want to sit this one out.",

The paralysis in Congress shows how many prefer virtue signalling to pragmatic governance, and would prefer to turn their back on compromise as long as they look good.  Black Live Matter is more than a slogan; its also a fact.  But what are progressives doing to make Black lives better?  Defund the Police speaks to a vocal sliver of the electorate, but dominates the discussion.  It's also idiotic.  Consider Minneapolis.  Voters soundly rejected replacing the police department with a department of public safety.  Why?  Turns out, people actually want police even while they may acknowledge the need for police reform.  The progressive recipe for dialogue on these issues, however, is toxic - to brand anyone who doesn't vigorously cleave to party orthodoxy as a racist, a bigot or intolerant.  That leaves a big chunk of the moderate middle without a coalition where their voice is acknowledged.  They do vote, however, and they have.  And they will in 2022.",

                "commentBody": "Terry McAuliffe represents the most recent in a decade long string of defeats for the Clinton wing of the Democratic party. It's rich to hear commentators from both Democratic Party establishment figures and Trumpers alike giggling about how progressive ideas failed to carry the day in Virginia and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the NYT continues to run this theme on auto-replay.\n\nThe fact is that across the country progressive insurgents have a better win:loss ratio than the party establishment. The geriatric leadership of the party just keeps trying the same old play book, and losing again and again. The current deadlock in Congress is only one of the results.\n\nThe one good outcome is that this finishes McAuliffe as a politician. He can now caucus with Rahm Emanuel, Andrew Cuomo, and Hilary Clinton in the museum wing of the party and grump about how \"those darn progressives are ruining life for us grown-ups.\" LOL\n\nYes, this predictable loss is a bummer for all non-Republicans. But, life is long and we accept that the progressive movement is a generational project. Check back in five and ten years and see if we haven't fundamentally reorganized the use of police power, addressed climate change in meaningful ways, and brought back basic fairness as a fundamental principle in American life.",

What explains yesterday’s votes and what will determine 2022 and 2024 is that we are a nation at war with itself; a fight to the death in which the MAGA hordes want blood payback for a “stolen” 2020, and a white rural/suburbia so fearful and grievance driven that even when asked to wear a mask to stop a deadly virus, it’s taken as a mortal attack on their very way of life.  A war that won’t allow a single Republican in Congress to vote his or her conscience because the Donald and Moscow Mitch would destroy them.  \n\nIt’s a fantasy to say that the Dems could reframe or re-message anything to win over or placate the fever pitch brought on by the Conservative machine over the past 40 years and the ongoing madness of DT. The high-speed autobahn to “Own the liberals” has no inroads for discussion or rest stops for compromise.

I consider myself center-left and I was completely turned off by his campaign. If I was living in VA, I don’t think his campaign would have motivated me to go out and vote. If anything, this result is a referendum against the moderate democrats campaign strategy of no policy, just scapegoating. I wish there was some substance in his campaign!

Two prior examples are same-sex marriage in 2004 and so-called death panels in 2010. In 2021, CRT and alleged \"election fraud\" are apparently more motivating to voters than affordable prescription drugs. Democrats have failed, in all these years, to develop a counter-strategy to this emotional incitement. When they win elections, they just pat themselves on the back and become complacent (which Republicans do not do when they win), apparently believing that voters will recognize and reward them for their superior policies.\n\nAnd finally, even though I generally support Democratic Party candidates, I am beginning to believe that so-called Trump Derangement Syndrome is real. Now that Trump is out of office, he no longer inspires the fear and anger he once did, and the strategy of linking Republican candidates to Trump will fail.",

Not only do the words they use mean just what they choose them to mean, but so do the words the rest of us use.\n\nOf course villains of American history on the right do it to. Newt Gingrich once called midnight basketball, designed to give kids something to do after school, a “special interest”. And Fox News commentators ginned up a “war on Christmas” because people like me said “Happy Holidays” to be polite and inclusive.\n\nIt’s delusional to think parental unhappiness in Virginia is due to an astroturf campaign ginned up by Rs rather than their own dismay at what is being taught in schools. It’s intellectually dishonest to claim that most people who object to the theories of Professor Kendi and Ms. DiAngelo don’t want their kids to learn about the fact, injustice, horrors, and residual effects of slavery and Jim Crow.\n\nIt’s interesting that many people who are black, gay, or Jewish seem to be the bravest and most eloquent when it comes to defending equality, our common humanity, and good sense in the face of this onslaught.

This makes them easy pickings for the GOP, who can invent anything from the continuing absurdity of \"the war on Christmas\" to ill-defined CRT or hyperventilating over the country not being as white as it once was.

The CDC of course knows nothing about health & safety.\n\nAnd of course any sane person is well aware that the bulk of all handouts, subsidies, tax breaks & favorable treatment go to billionaires & corporations. Obviously not to the lower &  middle classes.\n\nAnd as soon as every repub voter hears that they have to reveal their pronouns, that sex at birth and gender have no connection, that they didn't earn what they have because it was largely an unearned result of their \"privilege\", that their kids are going to be taught to feel guilty for being white in classes on race theory, etc..it's game over.\n\nThe reality seems apparent. The country is in practical terms evenly divided & strongly polarized into tribal groups, especially among likely voters. And most will never believe anything different from what they already believe, especially red state voters.\n\nSo in my view progressives have to focus on independents, GOP voters will never change. And to blame Biden for not getting anything done is absurd. GOP politicians vote against anything that helps the nation. It's largely on them.\n\nBut dems have to recognize that incremental change is all that's achievable. And quit expecting miracles.",

Absurd belief is not political it is insanity.\nYou ask yourselves can we afford a future and you say; no. \nThat is not moral, that is not even banal that is deep dark depression. It used to be that casting a ballot was a beginning not an end in America.\nOur job is to allow America to euthanize itself without taking us with it.\nNew York isn't liberal it is what it must be. That is called pragmatism. That is how one survives. I watched America go from pragmatic to ideological and now to insanity.\nAll I have left is prayer and don't know which deity has the most power.\nThe devil is in the details. \nI know Virginia and it is America.

But the significance of the study was its documentation of what happened. The cult doubled-down, made a story to explain why the first story didn't happen. It was as if the believers had a shot of fresh energy.\n\nCall me crazy, but what happened in Virginia has nothing to do with work-a-day realities. Biden does not need to be more this  or less that. Biden has morphed into a nonsensical chant. The date came, the saucer did not arrive, and those who were waiting for it are fired up, ready to go.\n\nBecause prophecy, you see, failed.",

Once one does, institutional racism is obvious and everywhere, and it really becomes impossible not to see.  \n  When progressives then talk about how hurtful Confederate statues are and the unmistakeable signal they send (as an example) many on the center and right don't really see what the fuss is about and think it's an overreaction, and the radical right weaponize these feelings into \"socialists want to control society and brainwash children.\"  \n  Results like Youngin's win resoundingly show this strategy to be successful.

If you're wondering what liberal fascism is, come to my school, where language is carefully monitored and divergent thinking is repressed. In other words, the distinction between teaching the history of race and slavery (I'm teaching Frederick Douglass right now) and corporate jargon speak of DiAngelo (nothing says racial justice like a well-paid seminar speaker). But I know exactly what's going to happen: the mindless sheep will go on chanting the slogans and phrases of progressives and Democrats will hemorrhage more seats. Sadly, that is perfectly amenable to the high priests of self-righteous zealoutry (ressentiment, anyone? those people should read their Nietzsche) - they would rather be RIGHT and cling to their repressive orthodoxy than think strategically about political power.",

The only party that cares about honesty are democrats. Independents don't, because the media doesn't. \n\nSo yes, McAuliffe can correctly say \"no, CRT is not being taught to children\" and Youngkin can say \"it absolutely is\" and voters assume the truth is somewhere in the middle. This is because of a \"both sides\" narrative that is prevalent in all news media. The base assumption that anything politicians have to say has factual merit simply because they say it is the first and foremost problem with our political reporting. \n\nDemocrats need to adopt better messaging to suit a dumber electorate, but voters need to be smarter. Unfortunately, gutting education is a republican priority and this means dems have to play the short game of winning elections so they can play the long game of preserving truth.",

Parents are reacting to the fact that many if not most students in blue states have lost around 18 months of meaningful education.  This occurred because of the power of the teachers' union over Democratic politicians and a general inability or unwillingness of Democratic leaders to assess relative risks led to the closing of schools. (Europe, which is far more progressive than the US in most cases, had kids in school for all of last year with no difficulty.)  Most people do not have school age kids so this reality has gone over their heads. Parents who lived through this have seen the damage and the flimsy arguments.  The intersection with CRT-type drama is that we parents who protested these bad decisions have  been called racists.  (Why let facts get in the way of an easy slander?)  CRT and trans issues get headlines but the core motivations of most parents are much simpler:  we want our children to learn.",

So this election result looks all too typical to me.  \n\nYes, Virginia voted for Obama, because turnout was high in those years, and Democrats win high-turnout elections.  Especially in southern states where strong Black voter turnout is key.   And Virginia voted against Trump, because savvy and well-informed Virginians, especially in northern Virginia (DC suburbs), were rightly appalled by him.   That repudiation of Trump even carried through to the off-year election in which Democrats won the Virginia legislature.  \n\nBut the \"blue\" Virginia counties are also full of people who earn good salaries and worry about high tax rates, and many of them are former military who work for the Pentagon-funded beltway bandit companies.  That is not a typically progressive demographic, is is a classic centrist Republican one.  \n\nMeanwhile, the rest of Virginia is a lot like states further to the south, and remains quite red.  Painting with a broad brush, white rural Virginians are in synch with (or in sway to) right-wing propaganda, and black rural Virginians don't always vote.\n\nSo along comes Youngkin, who is neither Obama nor Trump and therefore does not galvanize Democrats.  To centrists, he's pro-business, anti-tax; to right-wingers, he carries the Trump banner.  \n\nCall me not surprised at the outcome (I mean, even indigo Maryland has a GOP governor!)",

To a certain extent, the government does dictate what is taught in schools because curricula are issued by the government.  Were you to swing to the opposite extreme, you could have a situation where parents alone set the curricula, which could lead to anything from religious indoctrination to ignoring science.  \n\nConcerning the story about a teacher being suspended over gender pronouns:  The student presumably has parents who presumably pay taxes to support the schools.  If their child wishes to be addressed in a particular way, the teacher should honor that request.  Truth be told, a decent person with good manners would probably do so without needing much an explanation.  You cannot call for parental and community control in one breath and then allow teachers to assign whatever gender pronouns THEY want in the next.  \n\nFinally, the story about the young woman being assaulted by a trans-gendered student (or simply a boy wearing a dress) has been twisted by Conservative media.

My father pounded fenders in a body shop for thirty years.  My wife's family are all UAW workers going back to the 1940s. What about me is not sufficiently American?

We write our own.\n\nSo, in this case, the primary narrative on the right was that a girl was raped and and woke school administrators tried to cover it up so as not to undermine a new transgender bathroom policy.   It was about how the woke covered up a rape.  Sure, the transgender angle is there too.  The narrative the left tells itself is in the opinion column you posted as fact (and to some extent above).  This is why we can't counter their narrative.  We tell ourselves a narrative that makes us morally superior and have no idea what they are telling themselves.\n\nIn answer to your question about why I responded to your post and not the original, this is because I focus a lot on how media (left and right) mix fact and opinion and the column you cited struck me (when I read it a few days ago) as a good example.  Indeed, when the opinion piece was posted, many comments on it implied the authors of the comments believed the column  was news (vice opinion) and I wanted to pull my hair out.  I think civil society needs a better separation of the two.",

But so far I haven't heard of any one poling party choice.  I have heard McAuliffe say he didn't think parents should be able to tell schoolboards  what to teach. On September the 29th McAuliffe had a 40 point lead. On November 2 his lead had fallen to sub zero, He also tried to make an issue of Youngkin's wealth an issue. It's a little hollow when Terry has at least 30 million in his back pocket.  Again the  reason  McAuliffe loss is the person he will see in the mirror every day the rest of his life.

The science may back up why and how these are a good strategies to stop the spread, but the majority voting block is signaling they want a shift in policy around these issues. When does this all end? ...i s the question floating in everyone's mind. I think to many the answer has become when we vote an overreaching, mandate happy  progressive democrat out. To be clear, this is not my view, but it's what I think motivated the Youngkin win. If Dems want to gain a foothold in coming elections, they need to signal that all the mandates will soon come to an end with their very clear plan.",

This is the new Republican playbook.  Lie and soften the Trumpian edges.  But make no mistake, Youngkin is every bit the racist fascist that Trump is.\n\nAnd the mood of the country re Biden’s accomplishments - when will this country learn?  Republicans drive the country off the cliff every time they get in power then punish the Democratic administration because they haven’t undone all the damage of the prior administration in the first couple of months of being in power.  Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nAs for Manchin and Sinema - get with the program.  Your caucus and the majority of the country want what is being proposed in the reconciliation bill.  Now we have Manchin holding out the possibility that he might agree to something by Thanksgiving.  He will never agree.  He wants ZERO investment in people and social infrastructure.  He has said so to confidantes.  He is taking a page from the McConnell - Trump playbook.  Obstruct and run out the clock. So, at this point, what are the alternatives for the progressives?  None.   Just pass the infrastructure bill because Manchin will never vote for the reconciliation bill.  Yesterday’s results showed us that the population has no mind for subtleties of the situation.

The reason “progressives,” by which we mean establishment Democrats in most cases, are losing is because they refuse to take the formidable and firm stances on progressive issues that are supported by the majority of Americans.

Once again the democrats have taken up complex and difficult issues without laying the ground work. \n\nCRT, books in schools, masks, inoculations, etc are not simple sells.  In many ways they run counter to seminal American myths and thinking and are threats to the status quo.  This goes triple at the school level.  The Dems failed and probably will continue to fail because they have not engaged with people, especially independents on why these things are good for everyone, and more importantly that they are listening to others and not trying to ram something down their throats. \n\nThey must especially listen to the concerns of parents and have good answers or be willing to make compromise.  The teaching of “Beloved” is a perfect example.  Perhaps most college ready high school student could prepare for a book like “Beloved”.  But it is a difficult, often disturbing look at a time and a place they probably don’t, thou should, know about. Upfront consideration of both student and parent reaction and advance discussion of the subject matter could have saved a lot of angst.\n\nBe smarter and better communicators democrats.

What is surprising and annoying to me is that Democrats appear to have not thought two steps ahead. If cultural theorists are correct about the mechanics of structural racism in America, then we should expect that the mere mention of this fact will enrage those that benefit from structural racism. And, of course, we are seeing this play out on the national stage, because CRT is in fact a robust explanation of the inner workings of racism. If Democrats want to change the social conditions underpinning structural racism, they need to come up with a better plan than “calling people out.” I’m talking about politicians, not theorists or ethicists. The political job is to find the palatable way for Americans to get where we need to go: Democrats, go back to the drawing board and find out how to convince Americans to relinquish their grip on white supremacy.",

Most educated people have no trouble seeing the systematic racism and wholeheartedly support changing the white-washing of U.S. history.  However, alternatives such as Ibrams and the 1619 Project are so appallingly simplistic that they are clearly not viable alternatives.  More complex views such as Heather McGee's require more thought and avoid easy bogeymen.  However, such complex views have the benefit of unifying POC and lower- and working-class, much like Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned.

You have fallen into the linguistic trap that hurt the Democratic Party in Virginia’s gubernatorial election. \n\nLet’s reframe the issue so that everyone can discuss the concern at issue by asking first “what would you call an educational program that racializes everyone while identifying “whites” as (1) uniquely capable of racism, (2) creating a political and economic system favoring them and (3) required to atone for the advantages they were born into?”\n\nIf you don’t want to use CRT as the appropriate shorthand, perhaps because it technically departs from that doctrine of the same name first developed in the late 1980s by law professors, then what to call that something that California has recently mandated for teaching in, and other states are banning from, their public schools. And once we agree on the proper nomenclature, can we then have a civil discussion on the broader topic?",

However, I am willing to pay even higher taxes to support universal pre-k, funding for child care and climate change as well as other programs in Biden's proposals.  \n\nI also support education that honestly addresses the history of slavery and the intergenerational impact of racism.  If that is critical race theory, then I would support it.  However, I think the views of Ibram Kendi and Robin Diangelo are despicable yet their methods have apparently gained traction in schools and the workplace.  Young children should not be taught in school and employees should not be instructed in the workplace that all Whites are oppressors and all Blacks are oppressed.  Racism is a continuing problem, but systemic racism does not account for all unequal outcomes.   \n\nUnfortunately, the polarized politics of today have eliminated rational discussion and made progress on the important issues we face exceedingly difficult.  Hopefully, the results of this election will show Republicans that they can disavow  Trump and Democrats that they do not have to cater to progressives.",

Is it the Trump witches brew of faux economic populism and authoritarianism?  Will it be four more decades of catering to the corporate and ultra-rich donors with trickle down economics?  Will it be forty more years of running up record breaking deficits while pretending to be for fiscal responsibility?  What is the plan for the nation of the political party that issued no platform for the most recent presidential election?  Seriously, we know what they are against -- anything the \"libs' want to do to help average Americans.  But what are they for?",

When people put signs on their laws reading, \"God, Guns, and Trump,\" are they not engaging in a form of identity politics?  When a person claims that they are an Evangelical and that they vote their values, are they not just as engaged in a form of identity politics as a BLM protestor?  Part of the problem is that there is a tension between those who would focus on what unites us and those who would focus on the radically different experiences of Americans.  Imagine a conversation between a white, male suburbanite in one of the wealthier enclaves of Washington, D.C., and a young woman growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.  Could you really, with a straight face, say that they could both claim that America is a land of opportunity where everyone has the same experiences and the same opportunities?  The Democrats wrestle with these ugly questions and try to find solutions, while Republicans tend to paper over the problem.",

Not all ideologies do violence to the facts in the same way.  My larger question, however, is who exactly should run education if not the government?  You might say the private sector, but then people would simply send their children to schools that square with their political or religious assumptions.  Parents?  Well, at least part of education is learning how to swim in the larger world and becoming better socialized.  Besides, most parents can't swing the expense of educating their children.  The Church?  Okay, but which ones?",

Youngkin capitalized, often in clever, distorting and fear-feeding demagoguery on parental concerns and protest that McAuliffe ignored far too long. \nThe infighting of democrats in Congress does not help the Biden administration, and all the social programs (which help mainly the poor, but do little for the middle class) do not alleviate the present concerns about running-away inflation.\nJoe Biden was a welcome chan ge to Trump. But the \"diverse\" democrats with their capricious two senators do not have the power to get things \"done.\" Joe also did not realize that the GOP is not interested in bi-partisanship.\nThere goes 2022 and possible for the democrats unless the party finds valid answers to the existing and future  challenges",

Based on the example of European schools with similar community spread, that may not have been necessary; and it wreaked profound havoc on families lives, kids' education, and women's employment. I will never, ever, ever vote for an insurrectionist party, the COP, that attacked my country's Capitol. At the same time, I am now deeply mistrustful of Democrats' stewardship of education. Fortunately, this is a local issue, and I can work out these contradictions locally.

There is no passion amongst the mainstream Democrats. They need to call out the Republicans and name what the Republicans are actually doing, what they are standing in the way of, how the Republicans are depriving the people of the resources and programs and supports that most people in this country want, and that the Democrats say they want to bring into effect.\n\nThe Democrats also have to decide whether they're on the side of the people or the corporations. I keep reading that something over 80% of adults want the government to be able to negotiate drug prices for Medicare. The Democrats should be shouting this from the rooftops and making this happen. But it seems they are addicted to the other pharmaceutical - drug companies' money - and so do nothing.",

McAuliffe was on the defense and he seemed to get no traction talking about the serious issues that concern most people. \n\nClever strategy: Put the Democrats in the weeds of critical race theory (defund the police, government taking power away from parents, etc.), and the election becomes a cakewalk for the GOP.\n\nGive the GOP credit for their strategizing and messaging, but don't expect them to govern--like the ex-Republican governor of Michigan who allowed and covered up the toxic Flint water situation that did serious harm, especially to children. \n\nBut, we are early in the 2022 and 2024 election game, so I hope the Democrats were \"schooled\" in how ruthless, devious and deceptive the Republican Party plans to be in these upcoming elections. \n\nPlease Dems, develop a strategy and tactics to fend off the disinformation campaigns of the GOP and figure out how to talk about what is most important. \n\nAmericans are now conditioned to think in talking points, so communication will be the key--and facts & nuance won't.",

School boards, city and county councils, mayors, etc., are tangible and influenceable offices directly affected by one’s vote, and offers a one-to-one correlation with desired political, social, and even cultural ends.  \nHowever, less so with state legislatures or governors, and most particularly with members of Congress — as is so glaringly obvious with all the toing-and-froing over the Biden proposals, where a vote to send a person to Congress in expectation of passage of desired legislation rarely comes to fruition.  Gerrymandering, Big Money, corporate lobbying, etc., etc., puts paid to the aspirations of voters.  And eventually, voters will say, why bother, what we want to see enacted as law won’t happen.  \nBut, passions remain high for ACTION, any action, and local elections — and issues framed about local concerns — will get the people out and usually get the desired result according to how the popular vote went.  And “what to teach our children” is a formidable incentive to vote, no matter how factitious or distorted the arguments that  are presented…vote THIS way, and changes are immediate.  And therein lies the crux of the matter.",

The problem, as it almost always is, is the Senate's baked-in Republican advantage. Since Manchin and Sinema have effectively changed parties - supporting one GOP stance after another on a wide range of issues - Biden is forced to govern with a GOP-controlled Senate despite winning the Senate races in Georgia early in the year. Hence, Democrats find themselves in the position they always seems to: trying to pass popular legislation and somehow taking the blame when it doesn't despite relentless obstruction.",

What the Dems are proposing would barely get this country out of the bottom decile of countries that provide support to citizens on a number of major services, such as access to affordable medical care, child or elderly care, education, paid family leave...\n\nThe problem is that the Republicans have a broader and better disciplined media echo-chamber that frames the Dems as “radical left wing socialists”, trigger words for this country going back to the ‘50’s. Or even earlier.\n\nEven when the Dems have a good story to tell on vaccine roll outs, pandemic relief, getting the country back to work, Republicans are able to creat the narrative and frame the debate in their terms.  Youngkin didn’t have any republican story to tell about competent pandemic management, job creation, relief for the middle and working and poor classes, so he concocts this lie abut CRT being taught in schools.  Republicans have their fingers on the emotional pulse and what scares Americans and push those buttons when they have nothing else to offer - and they make it stick.",

The Progressive Caucus in the House act like little children, unwilling to stand together with the rest of the party and eat the elephant one bite at a time.  Manchin and Sinema prove once again that self interest is alive and well in DC, both hold outsized power, neither is working to pass Biden’s agenda.  Running McAuliffe was a mistake, he did little to excite most democrats, consequently many democratic voters stayed home and they shoulder much of the blame for Virginia turning red.  Lastly, the GOP in Virginia did a much better job energizing their base to get out and vote, even if they in part relied on lies, conspiracy theories, whatever, they got voters to the polls.  There are lessons to be learned here, unless Dems want minority party governance, they need to step up their game.  They need to learn to come together, 2022 is coming fast and right now it doesn’t look promising.",

Hopefully Dem's will take this as a wake up call actually pass some meaningful legislation in the next 18 months, expect to get slaughtered in the midterms, have the media have a fit and then win the presidency again in 2024.  We are in a pattern that has played repeatedly since WW II.  It is about time for the media to see this is what the American public does and report what is different.  What would really be different is that if Dems won the Whitehouse in 2024 and 2028.  Then we might have a real realignment.",

And actual parents are dealing with it.\n\nI'm in Canada and the movement to see history and society through intersectionality and some of the tenets of the latest versions of CRT, and other post modernist leanings, is showing up in my kid's education (and in the education of some of my friend's kids as well).    I'm looking at some of the books and education material being given my kid, and some of it seems lifted right out of things Kendi or Robin DiAngelo write.   The claims come across as dogma the student is to accept, which isn't surprising because, as critics point out, the very nature of this thinking has dogmatism built in.  It's baked in to much of this thinking that if you (in particular a white person) object, and give arguments against it, this only is taken as more proof of the theory.   Heads the theory wins, tails the skeptic loses.\n\nI'm far from the only parent who finds this stuff alarming.   Only pointing to certain lies won't address the real concerns.",

The kind the Federalist Founders of the Constitution were worried about, in terms of propaganda, demagoguery, inciting mobs, faction, etc.\n\nThe first step is recognizing reality. And that reality involves a lying campaign worthy of extremist organizations of the 20th century (see Klan, John Birch Society, the Communists, Fascists, etc.)\n\nAs for the opinion piece here - there is not much of a point. Just a bunch of ramblings and disingenuous assertions. \n\nAs for schools, sorry but have friends and acquaintances across the country with kids in schools of all sorts of grades, and nothing of the sort is cropping up in public schools. I have also been involved in local governments, and never saw what is being lied about, ever. Don't think even the \"latest versions of CRT\" (whatever that means) are being taught in schools on a general basis. \n\nBottomline: These were lies peddled for an electoral purpose, and the liars didn't get punished for it.",

McAuliffe was a successful governor, and could have easily focused on bread and butter issues that would have provided a counter narrative to Youngkin's messaging. But he didn't offer anything else beyond \" I am not Trump.\" \n\nI will say this again, but Democrats, stop with the \"we are not Trump messaging.\" It's clear that they need to offer vision beyond this one track messaging. Offer alternative and answers beyond the Republican's culture war messaging. A great start would be to campaign on bread and butter policy issues and to pass the infrastructure and social policy packages together. Get rid of the influences of the \"woke\" from social media and academia and present yourselves as rational policy-minded people. And perhaps you can avoid the bloodbaths of 2022 and 2024.",

Instead, we see one expert after another that attempts to put angry parents in their place.  Any expert in tactical politics would advise the leader to sit, listen and thank the parents for their energy and commitment.  \n\nParents are never wrong, to a mature politician.  The principle of governance is the parents are rarely there.  If you make them angry, on a principle of all things (come on), the parents stay angry, and stay there, and you do not get back to governance.

One is \"Resources for Teachers and Parents\", the second is \"Resources for School and Division Leaders\" and the third is \"Dr. Lane's February Reading List\" which is a response to requests from administrators for the \"latest literature\".\n\nIt is on the last list where the books Douthat complains about appear. It is prefaced with the statement \"Below are several pieces that I and other members of the VDOE staff are reading this month based on recommendations that we have received.\" Dr. Lane does add short positive paragraphs describing the content of each book.\n\nMy take is it represents professional educators trying to understand a deep and lasting problem in the United States so they can do a better job of teaching.

Addressing those issues in the educational system needs to be held off until the end of high school when those kids can accept that reality without having to feel ashamed of something they did not personally participate in. \n\nThe goal of talking about race should never be shame but realization.  That is critical to the future of our country  because as we continue to avoid discomfort for white kids, minority kids are being shown their histories are not important enough to have their ancestor's lives examined fairly.  \n\nThat shouldn't make anyone feel \"good\", should it?",

This one cannot be swept under the rug.\n\nThe voters are thinking this: if a president can make such a bad and misinformed decision on such an important foreign policy matter, how can he possibly manage the internal affairs of the nation? Isn't the current deadlock in congress an evidence of this? In the meantime, in a classic tone-deaf move, the president is touting how much he is cutting the methane emissions from a conference in Europe.

Thinking is not an allowed unless it goes along with the flow. \n\nInstead of corporate jargon and impossible schedules you have to go with CRT, LBGTQ, CIS, it's ok for a boy use the ladies room if she's wearing a dress, gender is not assigned at birth, apocalyptic climate change that's all there is to it and firing unvaccinated  who you've been convinced are all Republicans.\n\nIs it social engineering or incompetence? Both. We might all understand the need to reduce the cost of medical care and we'll never hear about. Maybe they're training to believe that once they are in charge all we have to do is lay back and they'll take care of us once the right billionaires and school boards are in charge.",

It's not far-fetched, but first, let's face it: Joe Biden was the right guy to beat Donald Trump but the wrong one to lead the new era that this country is screaming for right now. We had people thinking about race like never before, we had people on board with vaccinations, we caught right-wing extremism red-handed trying to overthrow the government, we had millions willing to sacrifice personal comfort and leisure for the greater good. Instead, almost 10 months after inauguration, we're dwelling on \"Let's go Brandon\" chants and letting free-range crazy people turn masking into a debate about American freedom when COVID-19 doesn't give a flying frisbee about the Constitution of the United States. Democrats need a grand plan to shift the conversation, and I think it lies in the new attitudes emerging about work. Everyone, from white collar office workers to truck drivers in Long Beach, are tired of the American model of working, as has become apparent in recent months as we return to \"normal.\" It's not just about the minimum wage. It's about making work more family-friendly, less frenetic. This is the Democratic Party's opportunity to seize, and they have to do it fast.",

This is not like political correctness scares of the past. It's not about teaching about slavery, Jim Crow, and racism, all of which I believe schools in my progressive community have been doing a very fine job already for decades. The fact is, there is a new way of talking about race, and new definitions of words, that became not only popular (among some including K12 educators) but required, like yesterday, and I don't necessarily or automatically agree with them. I don't agree that the presence of any racial disparity is, by definition, present racism. I don't agree that the United States' founding is uniquely evil -- more the opposite. I don't agree that the Enlightenment is merely a cover for racial oppression. I don't believe that we are swimming in \"white supremacy\" and that absolutely every interaction must constantly be assessed in light of race. I don't think Obama is an assimilationist Uncle Tom. I don't think black people are one way and white people another. I very much wouldn't want my middle schooler studying Kendi or listening to the 1619 podcast in a context that treats the controversial ideas in those sources as The Truth. Both of those sources are featured in a new antiracist curriculum where I live. I've read them. They're not good. It's time for a reckoning for the reckoning.",

There's anecdotal evidence that some voters saw McAulliffe as warmed over Clinton, which Joe Biden emphatically was not. \n\n2) They ran a candidate who committed an unforgivable sin, in the eyes of the parents of Loudoun county where the election was lost, he dissed their concerns.\n\n3) The Democrats fought Youngkin's dishonest anti-CRT campaign by not treating him seriously.  That, I take it, is Mr. Douthat's most important point.  You can't beat cultural warfare by refusing to wage it.\n\n4) Congressional Democrats failed President Biden and McAulliffe miserably by passing zilch.   Pass both bills now and then explain them and some sun will return.\n\n5. Find good candidates for 2022.  Doesn't matter whether they are progressive or moderate, just find winners. Meantime, avoid a dog fight over which faction caused the debacle: there is plenty of blame to go around.  \n\n6. Will Trump light become a Republican Strategy?  Let them decide.  Fix our own house.",

It is not a temporary lack of federal results on the left that causes someone to vote for the opposing party, especially not when it comes to a governorship which has virtually nothing to do with federal politics. The critical issue in this race (no pun intended) was education, and falsely labelling the majority of parents' concerns as blind opposition to teaching the history of slavery is exactly the sort of inflammatory and aggravating rhetoric that pushes the public into the opposing camp.",

Regardless of whether critical race theory is being taught to school children, it has become the catch-all phrase for the toxic blend of ideas promoted by the Great Awokening.  It is those ideas which voters are turned off by, on all sides of the political spectrum, by both Black and White.   It’s sad to see how Democrats have essentially been tricked into responding to the controversy with the pedantic and irrelevant point that CRT is a theory in law and social science and couldn’t possibly be taught to grade schoolers.  So true.  But it has an extended sense which includes various ideas which it historically inspired and which many people find abhorrent, including judging an individual on the basis of skin-color, the rejection of liberal ideals of objectivity, meritocracy and free speech, the denigration of “whiteness”, and the dumbing down of academic standards for the sake of achieving equity.  These ideas are in fact increasingly found in classrooms.  Democrats are perceived to support them.  Will Democrats disavow them?\n\nPutting their head in the sand hasn’t worked.  Media coverage including in this newspaper dishonestly pretends that anti-wokeness is just race baiting about a non-existent problem.  With that kind of analysis Democrats will continue to lose big time, even if Biden were to  manage to deliver on his agenda.  The so-called “cultural” issues simply cannot be trivialized or ignored.",

We just lost a solid blue state in VA, at every level of government. It's time to wake up. A colorblind society is heresy to progressives, but we must never forget that in the long game colorblind must be the goal. \n\nIn the successful evolved climate-sensitive world of the future we had better not be judging by sex or race at all, and if we still are that would be a future of failure.",

All a Republican candidate has to do is toe that line of fear broadcasted everyday, even though things like CRT are NOT being taught in their local schools or their police are not being defunded.  But, the populace comes to believe the lies because the conservative media is pushing it day after day.  Once a Republican candidate for office speaks the same untruths, these folks lock onto it and come to despise the Democratic candidate because they've been brainwashed into believing the Democrats are radical socialists.\n\nTrying to argue against this media tide is something that the Dems had better fix, and fast, because the mid-terms are next year.  Without clear messaging and clear legislative successes, this country will be taken over by the Republicans, and their lies, for a very long time.  It's time for Biden and company to explain this to the Manchins and Sinemas of the Senate.

To wit: a HS girl was raped in a school bathroom by another student wearing a skirt (who may or may not have been her lover, may or may not have been gender fluid). The girl’s father tried to interrupt a parents meeting meant to introduce a new genderless bathroom policy and was taken away in handcuffs, after which the County superintendent of schools told parents there had been no rape. Shortly thereafter an email from before that meeting, from this same administrator came to light in which he discussed the rape and approved the accused student’s transfer to another school, proving he’d lied to parents at the meeting. Then, the accused student assaulted another girl at the school to which he/she had been reassigned. And finally, as outrage grew, the same school administrator lied again, saying that somehow Title IX restrictions had prevented him from admitting the assault had occurred and/or removing the accused assailant from in-person instruction. All this rather than simply shelving what was in any case going to be a hard sell: allowing the presence of biological males in girls bathrooms and locker rooms.",

My first grader had no idea what half the things meant and didn’t have the ability to use critical thinking skills at her age to be learning this material. \n\nTwo: In college, I was required to take a class about diversity and yes, it included critical race theory and intersectional thought. We all had to take a quiz about our levels of privilege and also had to watch an interview with DeAngelo. My main issue with the class was that it only gave one perspective. It didn’t give any alternative argument.  It was: this is truth and anything that disagrees with it is bad and amoral. \n\nThe difference between a college class and an elementary class is that I’m an adult and can use critical thinking skills, and understand different perspectives. These kids are young and don’t have the same skills.",

I don’t think we should ban books or ideas we disagree with. What we should do is offer different perspectives. And give our children the ability to think critically about these issues. Even in the black community, not everyone agrees with progressive ideas of racism or anti-racism. So I’m not really surprised at the backlash.",

                        "commentBody": "@Arete’ Part of the problem is that Democrats are a remarkably diverse coalition, while the Republican Party is increasingly a party of rural, whites with a strong Evangelical bent.  There are exceptions, of course.  The Republicans have enclaves of support within the Hispanic community, but by and large the party does not have not to wrestle with some of the thornier issues of race and gender that the Democrats must confront.  Truth be told, its an old problem for the Democrats, going back to the 1930s when they embraced everyone from CIO unionists to southern segregationists.  Because they are a coalition, it means that Democrats have to address issue like police reform  or LGBTQ+ rights that are pressing concerns for some of their constituencies, but that might put them on unsure footing in places like West Virginia or North Dakota.",

Biden has been in office for less than a year.  The Democrats have taken a long time with what is--and let's be honest--an incredibly ambitious and transformative agenda.  We are still stuck in a pandemic and it has been less than a year since some members of the right--apparently with the support of many members of Congress--stormed our nation's Capitol.  And yet, the voters of Virginia (and possibly NJ) have opted to elect Trumpist(s) in sheep's clothing.  I am not sure anyone can say for certain what the American electorate actually wants.  The wave of retirements, by Republicans over the past several election cycles speaks both to exasperation with the current state of the Republican party and probably to the sense that running for office just isn't worth it.  Meanwhile, theocrat Ross pretends that the political party he belongs to is not actively planning to flush what is left of our republic down the toilet in the next few years.",

An education that ignores that reality simply isn't dealing with facts. It's like teaching biology and never mentioning DNA. The evidence of racism is there every day for anyone who cares to see it and it certainly is easily visible in the historical record.

There seemed to be a hope of meaningful dialog between the races. \n\nBut the surge did not last. After only a few weeks, although there was still sympathy over the Floyd killing, the white support had been rolled back.\n\nI think that the reason for that was pretty simple. The blacks and their many supporters in the media went on the attack against whites. I think that almost all white males were labeled racist.  All whites were also called privileged white supremacists. I don't know whom they thought would have guided the country through the turbulent 20th Century other than the white race. In the 19th century most of our immigrants were from Western Europe: the Irish, Germans and Italians. The blacks, having been kept illiterate for such a long time, were not ready as a class for responsible jobs until the last few decades of last century. \n\nThe worst idea that the progressives came up with was that on July 4th Americans should be so ashamed that they should dress in black and sing dirges instead of waving the flag and listening to Sousa marches.\n\nEven if the progressives were correct about the whites being wretches  who used others, did they think that proposing this to be taught in schools was going to win white voters?\n\nCan the Democrats stand up and stop the progressives before the next electoral disaster?",

The far right’s craven plans to further minimize and starve public education will be advanced under the guise of “parental rights.\n\nThe irony is that while many people is this country are angry about their position on the earning and status ladder and want better for their kids, they simultaneously insist that their kids learn only what they learned. Therein lies the self-defeating conundrum. \n\nThroughout the history of this nation most people have trusted public education to provide the ladder and the tools for their kids to use and build on to move up. These days, (actually starting in the 80’s; trickle down snobbery anyone?), many parents no longer trust public education. Many, particularly those who held and expected their children to hold manufacturing jobs, believe their public school education did not prepare them for technical jobs and/or their jobs were outsourced. They feel betrayed. They know they can’t control the economy, but they believe they can and should control “public” education. After all, they are “the public.”\n\nThe parental school control issue is deceitful and shamefully manipulative, but when people are angry and scared they lash out, they punish, and they make self defeating decisions.",

If its an off-year after Dems won, and you still can't win, it suggests you're not dong well, i think. \nit tells me, when more voters come out, Dems will win. \nConservatives best chance is to lull Dems into staying home.",

Pu-leeze.  The only time Republicans worry about the rule of law or the Constitution is when either can be used as a cudgel to bludgeon women and people of color.\n\n\nIt's an overused cliche, but as Pogo said in the funny papers, \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\"",

On the subject of race relations students should be required to read from both  Madison Grant and W.E.B. Du Bois. On the subject of religion students should be required to read selections from the Christian Gospels and the Jewish Torah, and also from the Koran, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Dhammapada, the Diamond Sutra, the Tao-Te-Ching, and others.

The first is a valuable method to explore systemic racism (e.g., property taxes as a basis to fund public schools, red-lining,  allocation of state of federal funds). The second is a myopic ideology that oversimplifies causes and solutions regarding the Black experience in America, entirely ignoring regional and global differences, other POC experiences, socioeconomics and family influences. As more (mostly well-off white) liberals and progressives embrace the latter, there will be more blowback against CRT, as we have stupidly allowed the second to define the first.  DEI consultants and educators have embraced the Kendi/D'Angelo approach (creating quite the racket), both of which conveniently argue that if you disagree, you are racist.  As a liberal and BIPOC, I warned friends that Virginia was lost the moment CRT was bundled with this new ideology. I cringed this morning hearing a journalist again deny CRT's use in curriculum when discussing the McAuliffe's loss.   Of course it is and has been for many years! What is new to curriculum is the Kendi/D'Angelo approach. Unless the left \"takes back\" CRT and rejects absurd and harmful interpretations of it,  the right will continue to win elections.",

That is, sitting in oaken-veneer classrooms, painfully abiding some minor great mind's  drafty droning on about one or another major great mind's earth-shattering examination of some burning issue.\n\nOn one such occasion, the topic happened to be the trials and tribulations of Puerto Ricans, on the continental mainland as well as on their insular homeland. To preface his lecture, the instructor assigned a Puerto Rican immigrant's memoir titled \"Down these mean streets.\"\n\nThe book egged on heated commentary from the students, and pyrotechnic outrage from one parent. Indeed, that father went ballistic, accused  the untenured instructor of the same crime that cost  that Greek gadfly Socrates his life, and pulled his \"little princess\" out of the class.\n\nWhen the dust settled, unlike the Greek, the instructor didn't lose his life, but lost his job instead. This incident took place over 40 years ago. The educational kerfuffle in the Old Dominion is just another instance of it.\n\nAs that old Roman saw has it: nihil novi sub sole",

Men like Ross Douchat and Glen Youngkin, and , yes, the Monster, will regard this as a victory.  They will disconnect the consequences of such fictions as 'unintended' and 'unwarranted' as they have for since the founding nation.  It sickens me that so many are determined that lies can serve democracy while the truth might serve only a few.

Which based on your own description, if you had access to fewer resources (like 70% of US population) might well have ended in opiate addiction (except, of course, you are far too ensconced in the 'upright citizens brigade' to ever succumb to that moral failure)\n\nDems lost in VA (& might well lose the midterms) due to internal Dem failures.

If Democrats want to avoid a complete disaster in 2022 the best wake up to what the public really wants - competency in Congress and the presidency, no extreme processive agendas, radical a divisive education agendas, dealing rationally with the out of control crime in big cities and no huge additions to the already excessive national debt.",

Let's look how the Virginia governor's race turned out after a new president was elected:\n2017 after Rep. Trump victory Democrat Northum won.\n2009 after Dem. Obama victory Republican McDonnel won.\n2001 after Rep. GW Bush victory Democrat  Warner won.\n1993 after Dem. Clinton victory Republican Allen won.\n1989 after Rep. HW Bush victory Democrat Wilder won.\n1983 after Rep. Reagan victory Democrat Robb won.\nSee a pattern?  Yes!  In the last 6 elections for governor in Virginia when a new president had just been elected, Virginians elected the candidate from the other party.  They did so every single time.  In 5 of the six midterm elections after that presidential election the opposition party won seats in Congress.  The only exception was after 9/11.  In 5 of those 6 elections those results meant nothing because the president then won re-election.  To write an article that does not recognize those basic facts represents journalistic malpractice.

It is brilliant branding by the GOP, managing to package racism as pleasantville oblivion, in a nice sanitary package. Grandkids will not learn how their white southern grandparents threw rocks at Ruby Bridges as she walked to school. Pragmatic reality is packaged as extremism, a trick that only extremists could pull off. That's the beauty of fascism: accuse the other of doing what you are doing. It is irrefutable.\n\nAnd so CRT is now in the Republican stock in trade, along with anti-abortion, unlimited guns, prayer in public schools, and the high taxes bogeyman. Were these debates to not \"go their way,\" none of these would impact the quality of life of the astonishingly vast majority of voters. Yet these wedge issues stampede those voters to a party that has as its raison d'etre funneling money to the ultrawealthy. \n\nThe Democrats are almost as exasperating. This is the legacy of Bill Clinton. Rather than making a true opposition party that stood in response to Reagan, believing in building a functioning society, Clinton and the Democrats went for Republican Lite. I get it. It allowed Clinton and the Democrats to win. But just over-response to terrorism means we lost the war on terror, over-responding to Reaganism meant we lost the war against Reaganism. And so the Democrats can change nothing. America is toast. Big donors loved it though.",

The idea of a Glenn Youngkin style nation campaign doesn't strike me as a \"pleasant dream.\"\n\nGlenn Youngkin wasn't some anti-Trumper who ran on a principled stand against the chilling effects of radical progressivism.  During the primaries, he repeatedly went to bat for \"election integrity,\" giving support to Trump's lie about stolen elections. He only acknowledged that the election outcome was legit after he secured Trump's endorsement. His attack on CRT in schools never mentioned Virginia's current standards or specifics of the state system's current curriculum. Instead he mashed up a generalized list of national anecdotal scare stories and topped it with a rehash of a decade-old fight about Toni Morrison's \"Beloved.\"\n\nThe Democrats need to do better, but that doesn't mean the opposition is doing right by anybody.",

The whole education issue is a dogwhistle to that fear: Those Dems that supported defund the police and rioting last year now want to expose our kids to the idea that homosexuality and gender confusion is OK; that all white people should feel a great sense of guilt because of the way Blacks have been treated; and that Blacks should now get a lot of extra freebies from the government because of this bad treatment. In other words, the educational system seems to saying, it's OK to be an \"other.\" And American parents are not prepared to do accept this. They're not prepared to move out of this area of their comfort zone. The whole ploy is a very clever way to clothe the ideas of white supremacy in a respectable Republican cloth coat. This Repub move is the right's world-wide move. As we see in places like Hungary, Poland etc.,  the right attempts to establish itself as the protector and defender of \"traditional values,\" \"traditional gender roles\" and \"traditional ideas of social class.\" Until the Dems figure out a way to deal with this Repub \"wrestling move,\" they will lose elections--and very badly.",

(It was Douthat himself who just recently wrote: \"I have my doubts about America. As a Catholic, my first loyalty is to a faith that predates and promises to outlast our Republic.\" The statement was inherently opposed to our Republic, to our Constitution, and to our Democracy.)\n\nDouthat is correct that it was a grave mistake for Democrats like McAuliffe to try to use technicalities to argue against critical race theory instead of disavowing it. McAuliffe's problems, at this point at least, are his own. It was beyond foolish for him to say repeatedly that \"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\" This may be technically true, but if you have any brains in your head you can't tell parents they have no say in their children's education. Republicans pounced, putting McAuliffe saying this in ads across the country, even where Democrats thousands of miles away from Virginia were running. McAuliffe deserved to lose; Democrats should say McAuliffe was dead wrong.\n\nDouthat's fellow left-wing columnist, with whom he used to share a podcast, has written a host of columns about how wonderful CRT is and how only the far-right has antipathy to it. If she took time to read the comments to her pieces, she'd have seen that the greatest opponents of CRT are liberals who read the Times.",

But this does not mean that they have failed to envision the ending. Mitch McConnell is the expert at writing the ending and doing what is necessary to get there. This is why we have a Supreme Court that has lost the respect of so many. \n\nThe question is this....Can the Democrats find enough energy, passion, and clarity in its values and policies to match the 'ends justifies the means' zeal of the Republicans?",

Perhaps, Mr. McAuliffe would have had an easier time on the inspiration & momentum fronts if his party hadn't spent the last three months in Congress failing to pass widely popular legislation.\n\nNow, let me guess, since this morning is a time for cognitive dissonance for Mainstream Democrats, the blame for the ongoing failure of their congressional majority lies at the feet of the House Progressive Caucus members and the some 67 million Americans they represent. Certainly, it could have nothing to do with the obstinance of two \"moderate\" Senators and the few big-money donors they represent.\n\nIn the words of a once and now possibly future president: \"SAD.\"",

Second, it is my strong impression (yes, only that) that the whole Critical Race Theory eruption was generated by the right wing having found a perfect whipping boy to whip. It would take an intense study of media over the least several years, social and otherwise, to determine exactly how CRT rose from academic obscurity to an issue that might have fueled a political defeat.\n\nI don't doubt, by the way, that academic theories are flowing too fast and too far out of the academy and are polluting our views of the world. \n\nProbably more than 20 yrs. ago, we were walking across the campus of Yale University in New Haven when I spotted repeated public postings about \"lookism\". Puzzled, I took some of the broadsheets and read, pondering what obscure and apparently weird idea was being kicked around by students. Lookism is now in the public realm, yet another thing to fear and get upset about and, oh, yes, try to correct. Apparently, everything that everyone does needs correction, all the time. We are nothing but a bundle of wrongs?\n\nMy take on the Virginia race is that too many Dems stayed home and McAuliffe, buried in negative TeeVee ads, never gave a strong rationale as to why he should be governor again.",

Biden won in 2020 because of overwhelming Trump fatigue, \"vote blue no matter who.\"\n\nBut Trump fatigue fades over time when the Democratic victors offer very little except memories of Trump of how bad Trump was.  \n\nIf Democrats will make clear that they will improve people's economic lives  and mean it -- eg, with $15 minimum wage, negotiated drug prices, paid family leave, free community college, a public healthcare insurance option (all of those were in Biden's campaign promises) -- then Democrats will win votes.  But all those provisions have been stripped from current bills or were never there,  and that's in legislation controlled by Democrats.\n\nThe Democrats in 2022 and 2024 won't survive on \"vote blue no matter who\" campaigns.

The failure includes the recent impossibility of our struggle with the pandemic: we are only about 4% of the world population and have 20% of the Corvid  deaths. The Delms are saying \"they have failed at messaging.\" No they have failed at helping people. That's what got Trump elected and that's why they are failing now. They are as corrupt as the Republicans and everyone can now see it.

Quite frankly, the progressive wing of the Democratic party could care less about middle class suburban voters.  Their class war purports to target the wealthy, but middle class voters understand that they will be means-tested out of most of the benefits Sanders is proposing and that middle class voters ultimately will foot the bill in the form of higher taxes now and in the future.\n\nSo by all means, go race ahead with all of this ill-advised social spending, while continuing to prosecute your insane culture war against mainstream America.  Give away money, raise taxes and double down on \"critical\" theories of all kinds -- race, gender, nationality, class, body image -- whatever you can think of.

I will vote against my own economic interests because I believe anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat, because I believe extreme wealthy disparity is unsustainable, because I believe every person in this country deserves basic healthcare outside of the emergency department.

I am having a hard time thinking of any policies that Trump championed that would benefit middle class women, suburban or anywhere else.\nThe following are positions championed by Democrats - all in Biden's Build Back Better plan:\n   Family leave policy.  \n   Universal free pre-school.\n   Expanding medicare to cover vision, hearing, and dental.\n   Expanded per-child tax cut.\n   Reduced prescription drug costs.\n   Two years of free community college to learn a trade / enter the workforce.\n   Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit to working families.\n   Subsidies per household to conserve energy / adopt clean energy.\n   Stop large corporations from moving the headquarters overseas.\n   Stop large corporations from exploiting loopholes to pay zero corporate taxes.\n   Better enforcement of tax laws to make sure that everyone plays on a level playing field.\n\nWhat did Trump offer?  Reduced tax rates for the richest Americans - that's it.  NO infrastructure plan, no investment in our future, and no permanent tax relief for the middle class (the minuscule cuts for those making less than $100,000 a year are set to expire shortly).",

To claim that \"Critical Race Theory is being taught to kids\" is reactionary propaganda. And moreover, any discussion of cisheteronormative patriarchal whiteness that combats the self-serving narrative of the white majority, in which praise for their gradual fulfillment of liberal ideals is utterly incontestable, is off-limits.\n\nWhy? Because whites wish to retain their place atop the social hierarchy. But white supremacy isn't a minor part of American history; rather, it's at the heart of American history. And to say that it is whites alone who get to determine how our history is interpreted and taught, well, this in and of itself displays the stranglehold white cultural power has on American society.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nNotice where this goes. This is a line of criticism that moves to undermine everything about our history, which means everything about modern society, seeing both as irreparably tainted by race-makers and slave-takers who set up a system that benefits and praises the white-male majority alone, in which all others must bend their Black and brown knees thereto.\n\nWesley Yang is right. When we stopped talking as much about racism and began talking about \"whiteness,\" that's when this \"Successor Ideology\" began to make its presence felt. Yang describes it as an \"authoritarian utopianism,\" which it is.\n\n<a href=\"https://sanzi.substack.com/p/ed-secretary-goes-on-the-view-and\" target=\"_blank\">https://sanzi.substack.com/p/ed-secretary-goes-on-the-view-and</a>",

In fact, the impulse behind CRT and other attempts to set the story of America straight are responses to the profound racism of white Americans.

Dems lost because they lost the group that does want to teach about the history of racism, but have been alarmed at disgusted by what this new woke antiracist orthodoxy is pushing - with the blessing of the Dems and much media.\n\nWith their full-throated embrace of woke antiracism, the Dems have lost the center, and even  much of the center-left.  The truth is, those suburban moderates and center-left liberals think that this woke antiracism is itself racist.  They will tell you this eagerly in a private conversation, and apparently, in the privacy of a voting booth as well.\n\nSo please don't conflate these two groups.  \n\nThese are people who were on your side.  But they have gone to DEI training sessions and been made to repent about their skin color.  They have been told by their companies when out hiring for new positions that they can't hire a white person for that job. Their school frameworks now include words like \"white supremacy\" and \"white privilege\" and punctuality and precise thinking have been attacked as tools of \"whiteness.\"  \n\nDems, these are liberals and you've lost them with your illiberalism.

When children are told they have to choose what gender is truly theirs, announce it relentlessly, and medically and surgically alter their bodies to be authentic, you get a lot of angry parents and badly harmed children.\nThese aren't the kids who used to feel this starting  in very early childhood, who mostly grew out if it, these are mostly impressionable teens, changing rapidly but locking in sterility etc while still to young to smoke.\n\nThe times could help by reporting on the facts these kids aren't getting in schools.  The drugs aren't FDA approved, many experts are sounding the alarm (yes, on the left, but just like when Trump was president, why assume one will stop being professional and follow politics not truth?)., But the New York times parrots the propaganda. Trans is not gay. Medicalizing young people who currently identify as trans is not the only way to help them, many need therapy instead.  And many detransitioners regret they weren't offered it.  They didn't even know.\n\nThe times could provide facts but has chosen not to.\n\nI'm liberal blue, so debates, facts, logic are good.  I think many conservatives want this too.  Does the NY Times?\n\nStep up please.  Great start with John McWhorter. But it's way past time for facts about healthcare, not synonymous with medicalization, for these kids.\n\nI am so shocked by your silence and eagerness to publish incorrect statements instead.",

Kind of a good vote getting strategy? If you win more elections you can then made a dent in helping people to better understand why things are the way they are around racism.

Republican land for nearly half a century, Virginia swung into the Democratic camp in 2008. ..The polls heralded a very close ballot. Glenn Youngkin's clear success sends a shockwave through the Democratic Party, referred to its divisions. His victory also revives the debate, on the Republican side, on the interest of betting exclusively on Donald Trump to take over both chambers of Congress, then the White House in 2024.\n\nThree observations stand out: the lack of appeal of the Democratic candidate, a former apparatchik of the party associated with the Clinton era; the flair of the winner, who knew how to keep his distance from Donald Trump; and, finally, the demobilization of part of the electorate that voted for Biden in 2020, disappointed by the administration's poor performance. \n\n...  High inflation, the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the images of thousands of Haitian migrants on the Mexican border: all of this explains the president's crumbling popularity in the polls, supported by only 44% of Americans. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2021/11/03/etats-unis-joe-biden-enregistre-un-revers-majeur-en-virginie_6100768_3210.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2021/11/03/etats-unis-joe-biden-enregistre-un-revers-majeur-en-virginie_6100768_3210.html</a>",

Douthat's pet issue is self-indulgent whining about how everyone doesn't agree with his own social conservatism, and that's what he's decided to blame here. The Democrats' loss is Virginia is significant, but it's due to multiple issues, many of them at the national rather than state or local level.",

Nowhere in his column or anywhere in attacks on Critical Race Theory is there a description or analysis of the actual curriculula in use in Virginia's public elementary and high schools. Yes, some people on the left use language that makes it easy for R's to inflame people, but the real lesson of Virginia is that Dems and the media have let R's get away with too many lies.",

                "commentBody": "I am a National Board Certified High School English teacher. Through many years of working at both affluent and underserved high schools, I have forged a centrist position on \"Critical Race Theory\" over the past several years. Frankly, I never heard that term until a year ago, but DiAngelo and others have been used in education for many years now. \n\nAs with all teaching tools, I sought aspects that worked for students and questioned others, while always reflecting on the strengths and limitations of my own perspective. \n\nThe centering of race in secondary English classes has been good and bad. On one hand, I have seen students of color empowered to question and analyze texts; they do not simply accept the canon because it's the canon. On the other hand, I often see the joy of reading sapped away for all involved. Of course, the loss of reading joy is a nexus point for lots of change in America. \n\nMy broader question as a teacher and citizen is, What should we teach? If the idea is that critique will lead to more fairness, then let's frame it that way. When Common Core started years ago, the argument was relevance in the workplace. That argument in 2021 oddly sounds anachronistic. For better or worse, I increasingly find literature and discussion to be a refuge from the world's madness, and my students agree. Thus, whether it's Alice Walker or Ernest Hemingway, reading acts as shelter for my students, a shelter to keep cool in a heating world.",

Therefore, Mr. Douthat, I see your narrative assessment as valid, sorry to say.",

They grew tired of hearing that our country is systemically, irredeemably racist.  And they took it out on McAuliffe and the Democrats.  \n\nIf you think I'm exagerating about the charges of racism, I suggest you watch a few hours of MSNBC in the evening.

A conservactive activist, Christopher Rufo, made it his mission for CRT to be the encapsulation of all the 'bad stuff' about anti-racism. The focus of his effort was to brand CRT as everything white people don't like about what non-white people say about racism. Rufo's work got the attention of the then president. Since then CRT has become the point of the spear used to attack Democrats. It's a weapon years in the making that was developed specifically to create a culture war objective that could be successfully attacked. Youngkin's success represent the deployment of this weapon. \n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory</a>",

Does Douthat support banning books based upon any ideology expressed within that is not traditionally \"conservative\" enough? \n\nLet's see how much the people of Virginia like it when Youngkin supports open carry without the need for a gun permit anywhere in his state. And let's see how much the people like it when he passes laws that remove a woman's right to choose. Or how much blacks like it in Virginia when Youngkin has the police cracking down on people of color as they have in other Republican run places. Three years is a long time for Youngkin to hide his Trumpian tendencies.\n\nYoungkin says he ran for \"all\" the people of Virginia. His voters will be disappointed if he actually does so. They voted for him to push back against certain Virginians (blacks & Democrats perhaps?) to reestablish the white race and its culture  as dominant at the expense of those who are not conservative enough.",

The GOP ad about the stressed mother was over 10 yrs old!  The high school boy who was assigned to read \"Beloved\" is now a law school graduate and working as a Republican operative.  Guess the book did him no harm.  So that ad was basically a tempest in a teapot.  If you want control over a school curriculum, get an advanced degree in education (so you know what you are talking about) and run for school board.  Otherwise, let the people elected to the school board and those trusted to set curriculum to do their jobs.  Would you like to have your work scrutinized by the public???  That answer is obvious. \nYoungkin ran on a series of lies.  CRT is not taught in any grade school through high school, including any college undergraduate level course in the US.  It is a graduate school level curriculum subject, for law schools.  So banning it will have the effect of banning unicorns.  It doesn't exist.  \n  The lesson to learn from this election is lies and fear mongering work on an ignorant electorate.   Virginia, you get what you deserve, nothing less.  4 years of nothing, no accomplishments.  You didn't learn from 2017-2021 in the US.",

The point is, voters of all backgrounds can see that the Democratic party has fully adopted a policy of racial shame because it has been catering to one, extreme side of its base, and the Democrats' adoption of this policy has affected most levels and most institutions of our society.  Calling everyone a racist who suggests that there may be better ways to talk about racism both in the past and the present is abusive of the intelligence of voters and the population at large.",

He is right, the personalities may change overtime but the elite remains and has outsized influence on politics and the rest of us.  This is how it has always been.  \n\nGiven the job performance of the elite over the past 30+ years no one trusts the elite.  Trump was a rejection of that elite on the GOP side.  Biden is simply a continuation of the Clinton faction.  The policies of this faction are seen as betraying the working and middle class.  The profound cynicism displayed by the Clinton faction have left many with a sense of betrayal. \n\nSo having The Brearley School, Grace Church, The Dalton School (etc.) engaging in struggle sessions and condemning Western Civilization in general so as to affirm various theories will only result in disaster.  No one cares about Grace Church.  What they do care about is their children. \n\nAn objection to CRT (as portrayed), which progressives and conservatives will agree on, is that its purported methodology is a zero-sum game.  It employs shaming and emotional aggression in an attempt to \"educate\" and to shift power.  This is completely transparent.  The acceptance of this by certain elite circles is viewed as nothing more than a canard because as we all know, in the end, this faction will resort to any subterfuge and design to preserve its privilege.  \n\nThe gall of this elite faction to believe they can continue to misdirect and cozen citizens so as to serve their own designs.",

Any business that releases a product that proves unpopular with a lot of people makes a huge error if its first thought isn't \"we have to fix the product\", but is, instead, \"we have to market it better\". Democrats may want to think about this. \n\nBiden got elected because:\n1. He wasn't Trump; and\n2. Because he was by far the most moderate (the leftists and  progressives didn't make it through the primary).\n\nBut since he got elected, he's been governing as if he's far left. And that has flowed downstream at the state level (in some states). \n\nThe majority of Americans don't want some revolution, or a fundamental re-ordering of our society. And in the case of Virginia, certainly don't want a Governor saying that parents shouldn't have much to say about what their children are taught in school (that is just insulting). \n\nPeople didn't vote for Youngkin because they were \"racist\", or because Democrats just had a \"messaging\" problem. People fully understand what progressive ideology is - it's just that the majority doesn't agree with it. They'd best remember they are supposed to represent people, not dictate to them, or 2022 is going to be trouble.",

I keep hearing stories of kids who don’t know anything about American history except racial oppression, and their parents are noticing and are justifiably upset. Claiming that “it isn’t real” when people are seeing it in their own kids is offensive and insulting. \n\nWe study the past in order to understand the present. There is a lot about America that you cannot understand without learning about our history of racial injustice, but racial injustice doesn’t explain everything about this country either. The people who founded the original colonies that would eventually become the United States had a variety of motives - religious freedom, self-government, making money, exploiting enslaved people - and conflicts among those motives have shaped us ever since. It is a mistake to focus solely on any one of those threads, or to ignore any of them.",

It's that simple. I'm not saying we should leave the culture wars unfought or let marginalized people fend for themselves. I'm saying that part should happen effectively at the local level and through state mechanisms. Practically, it isn't going to happen at the national level while we have the current SCOTUS. \n\nDems and progressives should spend a generation clearly articulating how their fiscal, environmental and social policies will benefit \"regular people\" everywhere and leave the rest alone. \"Regular people\" simply don't have the time or inclination to worry about pronouns, systemic racism or LGBTQ rights and concerns. It's just a fact. Let's win their votes with meat and potatoes issues, and then see what we can do with the dessert course.",

There's nothing anyone can do about that. \n\nI'm not so much speaking about this present economic moment, but generally about the fact that \"trickle down\" theory has never worked. Not ever. And the kind of brutal capitalism we now practice religiously is leaving huge swaths of people behind. Any mention of reforming it is met with hysteria over \"socialism\". This is a case in point of letting Republicans frame the debate. They've effectively conflated socialism and authoritarianism in the minds of millions. They've made it a black and white survivalist issue rather than a nuanced discussion about certain sectors of the economy. Thank you for giving me the chance to further clarify my point.",

The right made a bogeyman of the left and riled some white backlash, sure, but this failure rests on the Democratic centrists blocking Biden's VERY POPULAR agenda in Congress. Democrats (like Biden!) run on popular proposals then completely fail to deliver. Over and over again.\n\nIt's clear to any casual observer that centrist Dems are catering to corporate interests rather than voter (progressive) priorities that enjoy broad support: Medicare/Medicaid negotiating drug prices; raising the minimum wage; reforming immigration; paid family leave; and many others.\n\n\"We're not Republicans!\" isn't even a convincing argument for these centrist Dems anymore. McAuliffe was a Clinton staffer, not some progressive leftist. The centrists have nothing to run on.",

There was a story about a young black student getting a white janitor fired from Smith college, though the janitor had done nothing wrong or racist. Some schools in Oregon are saying that expecting black students to do correct math is racist. We have stories around the country of grade schoolers being labeled as privileged white oppressors.There’s a definitive push to make EVERYONE aware of their own race. I’m also still confused on any of this helps black people.\n I honestly think people are exhausted. \nIf we’re not inventing a new word to refer to Latinos or Hispanics (Latinx?!?!), we’re removing gifted programs and taking away opportunities from bright young students. Why not just offer extra programs to the lagging groups so they can catch up? Can we talk about having more positive familial involvement in education such as reading to your kids outside of school or cultivating a thirst for knowledge? No. We must take opportunities from others so everyone is equally mediocre. Did we think parents would take this lying down?\n\nHow many times are we going to hear that everyone and everything is racist? What is the solution?\n Do I agree with book banning? No. But I also don’t agree with lowering standards in our public schools to make the numbers look better.",

This has become a catch-all term referring to Republicans' general disdain for DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives). Obviously, CRT is not being taught in schools, but to many voters, CRT and DEI measures are synonymous with each other. Outside of highly educated liberal bubbles, most American's do not have a very favorable opinion of DEI initiatives. Mainstream American voters are supportive of equal opportunity but not equity in outcomes. Calling other voters \"racist\" will only push them further away from voting for democrats. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether these voters are \"racist\" or not; people will not vote for a candidate that dismisses their concerns as \"a racist dog whistle.\"",

If Douthat and co. destroy the public school system, the kids that rely on these institutions won't be competition into the elite institutions they are desperate to get their kids into.  The private schools this punditry class are sending their kids to are far cry woker than any public school in the nation.  They know public schools systems are trying to catch up and teach accurate history but they need to pander the dark money billionaire class.  They are going along with equating teaching history with CRT cause it serves their families.  The varsity blues scandal was illuminating as it showed us about the anxieties of the elite class.

While I disagree with most Republicans about pretty much everything, one thing is they practice what they preach. They live out what they believe even if it isn't what I choose to believe. As someone who lives in a primarily liberal area, I see so many liberals talking about things like abortion rights, fighting over pronouns, complaining about Dave Chappelle, or going on a march every time they get upset that even marches have lost their effect. Let's face it: liberals are really bad at practicing what they preach too. Most are rich and like to gate keep (I work in the entertainment industry and see this firsthand). Their problems are not the problems of most people, even though they like to comment on how the less privileged should live. Why would anyone want to take direction from these people? Liberals also bend facts (not as bad as Republicans but pretty close). What liberals lack most of all though is on the ground empathy. True empathy for different ways of thinking or understanding people.",

Liberals often castigate these parents as ignorant and upset over a truer retelling of history. But people are not upset about accurate history. No one is upset that we might incorporate events like Tulsa or Wilmington. No one is upset about accurately detailing the evils of slavery and discrimination, especially in late high school. \n\nPeople are instead upset about the consistent moral tone and condemnation of historical figures. Repeating that Jefferson was brilliant but evil is not accurate. He, as many were, was a man of his time. He committed many sins but also produced several brilliant pieces of writing and heavily contributed to the establishment of our country. Instead of focusing on the meaning behind his words, the focus has shifted to his abuse of his slaves. \n\nSimilarly, students are subjected to lessons which are clearly damaging to some groups self esteem. A viral video of a black parent describing how his mixed raced daughter is being taught to hate her mother just made the rounds. Misguided lessons on privilege, race relations, and morality have angered parents. It is not the more accurate history...\n\nAren't we supposed to believe lived experiences.

VA lost because of the way the bureaucracy of education mishandled COVID in blue states with such a paternalistic attitude (schools closed for a year when other places moved, safely, much quicker), schools still feeling like dystopian microworlds when adults are partying it up at bars, concerts and sporting events, etc... race and history were minor pieces of this. I am a life-long liberal and when I find myself agreeing with Ron DeSantis or Youngkin on certain matters, it is time for us liberals to wake up. These next few years are vital moments in history, especially in terms of climate action. We cannot waste them electing politicians because they are willing to keep our kids in schools when the blue-leaning leaders we'd like to be handling bigger issues are not.",

So, a Black Swan event, of which few people would have much experience with (maybe folks who worked on biological warfare and terrorism back in the waning days of the Cold War in the 1980s). \n\nIn light of such uncertainty, and with the sudden onset of the crisis, seems measures to be safe vs sorry are worth pursuing.",

Per the CDC's slide yesterday, kids 5-11 are four times more likely to be murdered than die of COVID. Suicide, obesity, cancer rates... all up. Our COVID safety has had unintended consequences that many predicted. Were those consequences worth the trade off of preventing COVID? Maybe for a time, but certainly not with vaccination for adults.  We have known the data on kids for a long time--since summer 2020 at least. Europe saw the same data and sent its kids back to school in spring 2020. Our blue states (and I live in one and am a parent of young kids AND have supported Dems my whole life) chose to position themselves as opposite republicans, stay closed, issue mandates for vaccines before they were even approved and are still restricting kids and schools to a much greater degree than much higher risk adults. You can argue about those policies and people do, loudly and viciously. But these policies are why a republican won VA--take a look at his margins among parents of school age kids. These people are not all concerned about their kids learning about slavery. Good God, its Virginia for crying out loud. They just want their kids IN school",

Keeping kids home did not keep people from dying and sending them to school did not exacerbate people dying. There are mountains of scientific data to support this.  Lots of people who support climate change, reproductive rights, equitable tax policies, government spending on infrastructure, investment in helping other countries develop, creating stronger social safety nets here (things that have been interests of people on the left) agree with me.  But dismissing my nuanced discussion of this and where different people might be coming from in their tolerance of these education policies and the bounds of government regulation as me not concerned with people dying is absurd. Things are not black and white. Me wanting my kids to be in school, normally, as the vast majority of the world's kids were (safely) while mine sat home, struggling, crying, losing an irretrievable portion of their childhood for NO reason (again kids being at home did not save anyone's life--we knew how to have kids in school safely in Sept 2020)... these concerns are not insignificant. And those concerns from similar parents in VA are, by my interpretation of the data from VA, why Dems lost.",

Same with the majority of schools in Virginia, from what I understand. This was totally insane, as was evidenced by schools like yours all over the world. I feel our governor did alot of what seemed to be political posturing about how here in WA state, we care about the kids. As though all of Europe did not. As though all of Florida did not. As though schools like yours did not. As though parents here couldn't look at the data and realize that kids in school was not a problem. We could have had our kids in school. We chose to signal our virtue instead. And I am just saying, if you look closely at the data in Virginia, it seems that kind of \"I believe in science but I am not going to follow it right now\" hypocrisy is what lost this race for McAuliffe (democrats). Parents felt this issue, viscerally, locked  in our own houses while watching bars and restaurants reopen. It will not be forgotten.",

The summer of 2020 was only a little more than a year ago, a time period that included a raging pandemic, one that killed  a lot of Americans,  and the emergence of a troubling variant.\n\nCiting mortality stats are irrelevant when faced with an unfamiliar disease. And, its not a wonderful disease - I know, because I know many people who caught it. Don't think it should be discounted based on current mortality statistics.\n\nData on kids have not been known for a long time, and there were / are questions about the possible impact of variants. Just like with the impact of variants on chances of breakthrough infections.\n\nOtherwise, so far, people who downplayed the pandemic and the variant had been proven wrong on many assertions, if not most.\n\nBy the way, Europe isn't monolithic. There were different policies for different countries. And the same with states here - some may have been overly cautious, others could have been deemed cautious, and then others seemed reckless, out of some political affiliation with extremists. \n\nAs for vaccinations for adults, have you checked the stats, because that rate has not been so great.

The schools stayed closed until the governor forced them back once sufficient numbers of seniors and teachers were vaccinated in the spring. The rhetoric from the teachers' unions was so toxic--blaming parents for wanting to get back to work so they could pay rent and feed their families. I knew then the Democrats were in trouble.",

She is arguing that opening schools should have been a priority and in many places was not, even though it could have been done safely. The mortality statistics for this disease are horrifying for adults, but not for kids. So arguments that this was done to protects kids are utterly disingenuous. Schools were closed to protect teachers, but that begs the question: if nurses could take the risk for their patients, why couldn't teachers take an astronomically smaller risk for their students?",

It didn't matter what issue was being discussed - for this particular type of New York Times reader, the problem was always the stupid, the ignorant, the uneducated, the selfish, the racist, the bigoted, knuckledragging, Trump supporting, right wing, other Americans who wouldn't follow the rules. If you spent the last year in self-righteous moralizing, last night's results should send a chill down your spine. Why it should surprise you that regular people don't like being called stupid and evil and selfish for wanting a normal existence is completely beyond me.",

I was speaking to my brother who lives in the Netherlands about masks and he mentioned that the children in the Netherlands do not have actually  have to.  No one does except for Mass Transit.  Their current new case rate is much higher then the US and significantly higher then NJ or California.  Vaccination rates are about the same.  In the US you would be considered a neanderthal for even suggesting no masks in school.  France has even set a limit for masking in schools at 50 cases per 100k.  Virginia is currently at 15 and has been less then 50 for the better part of the year.  Do the French and the Dutch not understand science.  What is scarier - this side of the debate is not even presented in the US.",

Mainly, the racism of moms who don't know that CRT doesn't exist (tell it to the NEA, ha!), and people who do not realize how glorious it will be for the nation to spend another several Trillions it does not have.

Germany, for example, is one of the most modern examples of a regional culture taking a serious look at itself in response to horrific actions done in its name. They have taken an unvarnished look at their history in the understanding that they do not want to allow the conditions that led to the rise of the Nazis and what they did. The USA has not done this and in fact has actively avoided addressing the original sin of our country, that of exploiting the peoples and resources of those who call our nation home, regardless of their origin of birth, with no consequences for those who abuse the trust in the founding ideals.",

Perhaps they should have begun by denouncing the myth that CRT is being taught in schools, then have had the courage to denounce CRT. Perhaps they should have spoken to working peoples needs and offered a plan to address those needs. McAuliffe gave away the election.  I fear he is a prequel to 2024.

And a corollary to that is the wisdom of compromise.\"\n\nThat is a good definition of the form of intelligence that I most value within myself and other people, and is distinct from the ideological form of intelligence.\n\nAs measured by IQ, a person with high-IQ can be either the one of the other. But at least in my own opinion, the problem with the education system is that it tends to only recognize the latter, ideological form of reasoning, because that is a form of \"group think, whereas being \"inquisitive\" is the best way to think independently.\n\nTo be more to the point, the education system, especially at university, displays a tendency to Discipline and Punish, to borrow a phrase from Michel Foucault, the student who diverges from their \"group think\" form of ideological reasoning. Thus, students are taught to NOT think independently, and to NOT be \"inquisitive\", and are rewarded with high marks for conforming to the \"group think\" idealistic reasoning of their lecturers.\n\nAs a consequence, in terms of intellectual development, the real growth in intellectual reasoning occurs after leaving university, at least in my own personal experience. That is when you have the intellectual freedom to transcend the ideology that you have been taught by your lecturers, and can learn to think at a much higher level.\n\nFor example, most of my lecturers were Western Marxist. Being non-Marxist allows one to think more clearly.",

We sent our kids to a high end Montessori school 30 miles from Manhattan and spent $8.5k per child.  The education was excellent.  At some point some reasonable people might ask what is going in with the money.  Just this week or maybe last there was an article in the NYT stating that the school population of NYC decreased by 50000 since the pandemic.  My first thought was wow - they can now offer free pre-K education to 50,000 kids and have the funds to pay for it.   But that is wishful thinking.  I know it wouldnt be easy - but If I really cared about this - I would find a way to do it.  The left just complains it is the billionaires fault.  The left gets blinded, some of these problems can get solved.  The answer isnt always more money.",

One school official sending around one reading list two years ago doesn't cut it.\n\nImagine if Democrats claimed that all Republican politicians are pedophiles because Matt Gaetz stands accused of trafficking an underage girl, and Dennis Hastert molested wrestlers, and .Jim Jordan was complicit in the Ohio State scandal.   Sure, there's an element of truth, but also a whole lot of unfair exaggeration and extrapolation.\n\nAlthough the GOP success in pushing the CRT boogeyman suggests that the Matt Gaetz strategy may be one way forward for the Democrats.

It's a shame kids of this nation are not exposed to an honest account of our history, and it's peculiar that Democrats have yet to find a way to deconstruct the Boogeyman of CRT.

I went to law school from 1991 to 1994 at the University of Virginia.  Critical race theory was then being openly espoused and examined in law school curricula, including at UVA.  It was fringe theory then, and on the merits it deserved to remain so.  It had some, but not a lot, of explanatory value.  But it had (and has) very little positive policy implications for a nation governed by a Constitution with the 14th Amendment and that has laws and regulations seeking to make race irrelevant.  Yet it has now seeped out of rarified academic circles, and it does no good for Democrats to say \"it isn't being taught in Virginia\" when the DOE recommends CRT materials throughout its own website.  Those in favor of CRT need to defend it on the merits if they think they can.",

No doubt there are a few people who would rather kids not learn about slavery and racism, and they may use this moment to push their opinions. However, it really perplexes me to see the degree to which media people think this has anything to do with the anti-CRT movement or with the schools themselves. As someone who creates history curriculum materials, I can attest that race, slavery, Jim Crow and the Civil Rights struggles have been perhaps the single most prominent part of American schools' H.S. history curricula for DECADES. One of my favorite states to visit to promote my stuff has always been TEXAS, where a vigorous group of social studies coordinators were always ready to buy materials dealing with all of the above named topics. The notion that the push against CRT style racial hectoring has a thing to do with bigots opposed to teaching the realities of race in America is simply absurd.",

You're firing too many neurons, conjuring up debates about Critical Race Theory and the writings of Ibram Kendi and Robin DiAngelo. Whoever they are, I'd bet big money that only a tiny minority of voters know who they are. A simple application of Occam's razor can explain the Virginia result. Two obvious facts are most salient: this is an odd year election and the fact that Democratic voters are not always reliable.",

That can’t be foist upon them in the public schools THEY PAY FOR.\n\nBut the line is that CRT, even though it is not taught in public schools and they’ve probably never heard of it before, will make their kids feel bad.  So, they rise up in a fury of parental protection unavailable for the physical toxins assaulting their kids, or the real dangers of a country bristling with guns.\n\nBottom line: it’s the old Welfare Queen dodge.",

Many white working people in this country struggle to stay afloat and support their families. The last thing they want to hear is how they, or their kids, have to feel terrible because of slavery, and how they might have to give up more of what they don't already have. They don't understand the concept of white privilege because they are in a constant struggle to survive themselves: not because they are racist. That is not to say that here are no racists: there are, but not everyone who questions CRT is a racist. Dems need to figure that out, and find a way to have productive, inclusive discussions, and stop campaigning on Trump. Campaign on how they are proposing to make people's lives better.",

That's why the party did what was necessary to keep Senator Sanders from being its 2020 presidential candidate; had it not done so, we would still be talking about President Trump in the present tense.",

Then then liberals say \"how dare you notice what we're doing\" because to them the innovation is totally justified, appropriate and maybe even inconsequential so they consider any opposition to be wholly uncalled for. But if conservatives just make nice or rationalize why it's ok or not a big deal it leads to more and more change. So they do have to die on some inconsequential hills along the way.",

Not only do they harp on it, they lie about it because they know they can get away with it.  Then, somehow, the NYT feels they have to report on it and explain it, when in reality they should just ignore it.\n\nRepublican strategists just chuckle and laugh.\n\nNormal Democrats/liberals would like to see some harping on lower rx drug costs, healthcare, workers rights, and the environment, but the booboisie simply can't get their heads around any of it.  Too much thinking required.  'Culture wars' are so much easier.\n\nI'm done also.  Why should I bother when at least half the country thinks the nonsense Republicans make up is real and matters.\n\nHappily, I am finding myself more able to move on these days.  I was pretty upset for a while, but now I see America the way the rest of the world sees us: a world power in decline.  Oh well.",

The attack on CRT really is just a new way of saying the n-word, but it would not work the way it does if multi-millionaires like Terry McCauliffe and Joe Mancin didn't have a death grip on the upper reaches of the Democratic Party.",

It's another of the \"red meat for the right\" non-issues that gets them to the polls without a trace of critical thinking involved.\n\nEqually ridiculous was the quote from McAuliffe from one of the debates where he said parents shouldn't be telling schools what to teach.  He's right.  Curricula are developed with lots of public input, but curricula are not and should not be subject to cafeteria style picking and choosing.  It certainly wasn't when I was in school.\n\nIt's gonna be an interesting next couple of years, because Youngkin and company have no mandate.

Maybe those ideas are worth defending. Maybe Kendi and DiAngelo are worth celebrating. Maybe school superintendents who recommend their work should be praised for doing so.\n\n\"If so, Democrats should say so, and fight boldly on that line. But if not, then Democratic politicians in contested states, facing Republican attacks on education policy and looking at the unhappy example of Virginia, should strongly consider acknowledging what I suspect a lot of them (and a lot of liberal pundits) really think: That the immediate future of the Democratic Party depends on its leaders separating themselves, to some extent, from academic jargon and progressive zeal.\"\n\nMan, I think Douthat hit the nail on the head. Dem. moderates are the weak link here. They probably grasp the paradigm shifting potential of this moment but lack the imagination to find a progressive path that works. Douthat rather obviously expects them to back away from this opportunity in order to protect their perceived interests. It's the kind of misperception that keeps us floundering. And then, yes, Democrats lack the rhetorical acumen to get the progressive job done. HRC is exemplary.",

Conservatives are manipulable by the wounds of the past just as liberals are; the conservative version shows up as more naked fear (and in this era, as action toward overt domination by authoritarians) whereas actual liberals--not so much progressives--are more prone to experience the fear as guilt  (showing up in evasion and squishiness.) And, if I may use the term, the Democrats were deplorably naive not to see this coming; I think we agree on this. The combination of racial issues and schoolchildren will send people out of the heads almost instantly. I am a survivor of the Kanawha County Textbook Crisis of 1974-75. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org</a> /wiki/Kanawha_County_textbook_controversy   This Wikipedia article text keeps changing because the issues are still alive--it refers now to the establishment of private schools that teach \"Christian principles\" which I consider quite lacking when compared to the Catholic principles I was taught in high school there. The non-Catholic schools are more insular both in curriculum content and in enrollment. While Catholic schools often include children of minority backgrounds, these \"Christian\" schools are virtually all-white and seek to ensure that children do not directly encounter or engage with anything that would frighten their families. This perpetuates ignorance. What Jesus modeled was inclusion, love for the poor and compassion for differences. Do we?",

That person would still not be Trump. The issues in the midterms will overwhelmingly favor Republicans and pull in a number of independents and even some urban Democrats: crime and the Covid mandates. (I live in downtown Chicago where a sharp rise in crime--carjackings, shootings, muggings, armed robbery, flash-mob shoplifting and street crime in general--has made the term \"Lakefront liberal\" obsolete.) And most of the commentary I've read still fails to fully grasp the momentum behind Trump's bid for another term. These are his issues, and even \"Sleepy Joe\" was given new life when Biden appeared to doze during the climate conference. I'm not saying Trump is inevitable, but in light of Tuesday's results, who do you think would win if the election were held tomorrow?",

The Richmond area red but probably close.\nThe rest of the state, more rural, red.  I honestly think it's because they don't get much of the detail about what the GOP is actually doing.  Small town newspapers don't publish it, either because the owners are GOP or because they don't want to alienate any readers.  Many don't have cable.  \nI spoke recently with a friend who, with her family, raises cattle on their farm in southern Virginia. I mentioned the new Texas abortion law and - seriously - she didn't know what I was talking about.",

My husband was working on a construction site at a SUNY campus. The campus officials told the construction crews what restroom to use. It was the same gender -neutral restroom that eight- year-old girls attending a summer camp there were also using.  But the men didn’t know until they entered the bathroom. Some left, others didn’t. \n\nThese gender -neutral bathrooms were forced upon us because a tiny percentage our population might feel uncomfortable.  I am not sure if a trans person ever used that bathroom, but that day male construction workers and young girls were in stalls next to one another. My husband was horrified and came home and said “is this REALLY what they want??”\n\nThis is just so wrong. Give us our bathrooms back.",
