If you were one of the millions of Americans who struggle to pay their taxes, and especially if you were among those whose wages and property were seized by the IRS for non-payment of taxes, wouldn't you be more than annoyed by this information?  Wouldn't you want to grab a torch and storm the White House?  \n\nI'm no millionaire, but I do all right.  I've paid my taxes every year for the past 45, never late, never cheated.  I pay my taxes without complaint because I believe, like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr that: \"Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.''  Apparently, Trump disagrees.",

If you miss a quarterly property tax payment - say, you are in the hospital, comatose - your local government will seize your home. They may do this even if you don't pay your sewer tax. Basically, in America, you don't own your own home, you rent it from the government (a slum landlord which does no repairs). New Jersey, with the highest property taxes (I pay more in one month than Trump or my friend in Florida pay in a year) has the highest rate of property tax foreclosures. High property taxes also drives up rents. Trump went after our meagre SALT deductions - contrary to popular opinion, this move was NOT just targeting the rich. My income after taxes is $35,000 because my property taxes are about $14,000. I might get a $2000 or $3000 deduction in a good year. Trump instead took an extra two weeks pay from me in addition from taking away that deduction. He is an enemy of anyone who isn't rich.",
