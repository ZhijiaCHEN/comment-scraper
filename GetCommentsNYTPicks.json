Business losses should not be used to reduce person tax burden. Losses should not be carried forward for 18 years. Nobody should be able to go back in time and claim old losses from 2 years ago, let alone 4 or 5, to get a tax refund for years when they did pay taxes. \n\nOur tax laws are designed to allow businesses and the wealthy to live here for little, even though they benefit the most from an orderly society. Hopefully people read this and demand better. How can a self professed billionaire pay $750 in income tax?? It is obscene.",

During the last ten years  our President has stiffed his creditors to the tune of $287 million.  This is the guy with the nuclear codes.  \n\nThe country has survived stupid presidents before. We elected Dubya twice and we're all still here. We have elected crooked Presidents before. We elected Dick Nixon twice and we're all still here.

Maximizing deductions for depreciation under the substantially expanded rules in TCJA '17 is avoidance. Deducting a private jet, unless he pays his company the going rate for private use of a jumbo jet, is tax evasion. \n\nWhat I saw in this article exceeded that fine line. Excessive deductions and misuse of mixed-use assets. Above-market consulting fees to related party businesses for little or no work. An intent not just to lower effective tax rate, but to transfer money to relatives  to elude gift and estate tax. Likely inflated values of partnerships in order to deduct the initial investment lost under \"walkaway rules\" - and then failure to include any recoupment of losses in later tax years. \n\nI hope this makes people angry. This is why I research and study tax law \u0026 policy, and don't file returns for the wealthy. While all of this was going on, Trump was also significantly reducing funds for IRS enforcement and audits for high-net worth individuals... while expanding audits for the poorest of the poor who receive earned-income tax credits (EITC).",

They will continue to simply parrot his \"fake news\" mantra.\n\nAfter this revelation, there is no doubt that Trump voters are nothing more than a cult. And with our system of government that permits the minority to elect a president, we could well see this grossly unfit man elected to a second term.\n\nThere have been so many revelations about Trump - based on his own conduct and actions - that would have been the nail in the coffin for any other president - and yet his voters are still in lockstep with him.\n\nJust further evidence that we are no longer in the America we knew before 2016.

I resent also that our tax code allows him to do so.

I recall the last time I paid about $2000 in taxes was some 20 years ago as a newly recruited sailor in the US Navy. To think that the President of the United States and a billionaire, paid $750 in federal taxes in two years of his presidency and paid zero for more than eighth yeas earlier, just brings me to tears. How did 300 million people be so conned of their ways, values, democracy, identity, and heritage by someone who will go to any extent to deprive the system of its only lifeline...taxes receipts!!! How could 300 million people lose their way?",

(The one published last year or in 2018 by the Times on a very related subject was, too.)  We need the main messages from this report distilled and broadcast as widely as possible and as frequently as possible across the fifteen or so swing states.  But Americans without college degree have little time or vocabulary to read wonkish tomes.  And yet we need to reach such Americans with the message that President Trump is one of the greatest conmen ever to have to eyed the Presidency lustily.  So how to do such a thing?  I wish with all my being to the High Heavens that someone will conceive a project to make a series of YouTube videos based on the nuggets of this article.  In those vidoes, someone like Sarah Cooper or someone as talented as her, should basically, in  a mocking manner, regale American with the terrible disconnect between the image of the populist, 'actually very rich' businessman that Trump claimed ad nauseum since 2015, on the one hand, and the reality of a deeply-flawed businessman whose ventures were chronically plagued by mountainous losses for example that shielded him from paying any federal income taxes for as many as eighteen years, in one specific case.  For years two years in a row, Mr. Trump has paid less than US dollar 1000.00.  The disconnect is really stomach-turning.  If Americans can't harvest political bounty this offers at the expense this peril to democracy, it'd be shame",
